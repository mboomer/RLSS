	lane markers can help
	swimemrs can get entangled
	most will self correct

TASKS & ACTIVITIES

NOP identifes tasks/activity hazards & special arrangements

	craft patrol
	boats/wide surfers/kayakers
	spectators


PEOPLE

	SWIMMERS
		will occassionaly collide
		lane rage
		good course/event management will
			reduce conflict
			reduce injury

	normal to be part of team
	underatsnd role
	self declare if role is beyond ability

OTHER USERS

	Dog wlaker

	plants near water edge
	slippery edge
	watch out for animals

	hidden currents
	depth of water changeable
	polluted
	objects under water

HOW TO SPOT A CASUALTY

	WEAK SWIMMER
		poor swimming stroke
		tired
		minor injury
		shouting for help
		waek stroke
		panicking
		will respoind to help
		will reach for rescue equipment

	NON SWIMMER
		cant use basic swim strokes to keep head abouve water
		physically exhausted
		are panicking
		dont know how to swim
		not calling for help
		vertical in water
		kicking legs but not help them
		moving arms vigously

		may go under water quickly/quietly
			may have only 20 sec
				
		will not respond to commands
		wont reach for rescue equipment

		all efforts go to keeping head above water & breathing
	INJURED
		muscle cramps
		cuts/brisues/broken bones

		shouting for help
		lying still in water
		holdoing injured part
		looking in pain

		adjust technique to avoid making injury worse
		may need extra help to get casualty out of water


	MORE THAN 1 CASUALTY
		may panic and will grab hold of another swimmer
		if a friedn tries to help - may get into difficulty

		place a support between casualties
		take enough rescue equipment to support both
			resvue board
			torpodeo bouy
	UNCONSCIOUS
		bang on head
		medical issue
		drunk

		floating face down on surface	
		sink under water

		if umconscious person is face down in water
		they will stop breathing
		you must start their breathing again asap

PRINCIPLES OF PERSONAL SAFETY

	APPROACHING A CASUALTY
	
	conscious distressed
	contact zone
		area around casualty where you at highest risk
		casualty can grab you/clamp on to you
		this can stop them swimming
		can lead to both drowning
		
	keep at least 2m away until ready to act
	when close enough 
		move more slowly
		clamly firmly give instructions
	if have torpedo bouy/rescue board
		pass it to them
	dont do rescue without equipment
		may have to in 999
	always better to put barrier between you and the casualty
	
	STAND OFF POSITION
	
	if you need to do a contacter

	Float on back
	raise one leg out of water
	slowly scull towards them
	if they try and grab, push away with rasied leg on shoulder
	reassure them you are there to help

	ESCAPING FROM A CASUALTY

	from front
		tuck in chin
		hands under ribcage
		push casualty up / sink down
		swim away
		get into standoff position
		reassure them
		
	from behind
		tuck chin in
		hands on elbows
		push up, sink down and swim away
		get in standoff position
		reassure them

	GENERAL PRINCIPLES

	hold your breath
	tuck chin in/protect throat
	go underwater
	if refuse to let go
		push away with legs or arms
	break casualty grip
	move to safe distance
	re-assess situation
		continue with team support
	if you have torpedo bouy in front of you
		casualty will grab that and not you

PRIORITIES OF CASUALTY MANAGEMENT

	Life threatening emergencies must be first

	Emergency CPR
	Choking
	life threatening bleeding
		may have to do stop bleeding before starting CPR
	unconscious breathing casualty
	shock
	medical attention

PRIORITIES OF CPR & FIRST AID

	Preserve life
	alleviate suffering
	prevent situation getting worse
	promote casualty recovery

	set out in Emergency action plan

	ABC of survival

	A - casualty airway is open
	B - look listen feel for breathing
	C - start chest compresssions

CHAIN OF SURVIVAL

	Early recognition
		pervent cardiac arrest
		call 999 get prof help/ambulance
	early CPR
		should start CPR asap
		buy time
	early AED
		carried by ambulance/public areas
		restart heart
	post resuscitation
		restore quality of life
		medical/para-medical procedures
			injecting drugs
			ventilation equipment

CARDIAC ARREST

	heart stops pumping blood around body

	blood to brain is stopped
	can cause seizures, similar to epilepsy
		assess for normal breathing after seizures stop

	Agional GAsps

	after cardiac arrest
	infrequest noisy gasps(snoring)
	this is NOT normal breathing
	
	START CPR IMMEDIATELY

PRINCIPLES OF AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

	head tilt / chin lift
		lift tounge and open airway
	look
	listen
	feel for breath

CPR FLOWCHART

	Unresponsive / not breathing

	call 99 / ask for ambulance

	drowning, child, infant	
		5 rescue breaths

	30 chest compressions

	2 rescue breaths

	continue CPR 30:2

	as soon as AED arrive start defibrillation

DROWNING & CPR

	5 initial rescue breaths

	if possible recover on to side of pool or firm surface
	may have to start rescue breaths in water
		is possible in deep water
		mouth to nose is preferable
		frees an arm and hand
			to support casualty/hold on to side
			to close nose/mouth 

	Effects of drowning
		effects of water in lungs can be delayed up to 72 hrs
		if anyone submerged/needed resuscitation
			call 99 and get medical attention

CHILD & INFACT CPR

	more common to have airway/breathing problems
	alwasys start with 5 rescue breaths
	
	child : 1 year -> puberty
		one hand
	infact : -> 1 year
		2 fingers

	chest compressed 1/3 of depth
	
	if alone perform CPR for 1 minute before going for help

HYPOTHERMIA

	starts when core body temp < 35C

	may still suffer effects if old/young

	exhaustion
	intoxation
	immobilisation
	immersion in cold water
	cold water conditions		

	SYMPTOMS
		COld
		slow pulse
		tired
	SIGNS
		shivering
		change in behaviour
		slurred speech
		confusion/forgetfulness
		stiffening of muscle
		pale cold skin
		infacts may become quiet

	TREATMENT

	summom 999
	handle gently
		rushed treatment may cause heart to stop
	move to warm place
	remove wet clothing
	sit in comfortable position
	wrap in blankets
		before wrapping in foil blanket
	in remote locations
		place in plastic bag up to neck
		cover their head
	sip warm drink / eat high enrgy foos ( chocolate)
	monitor breathing / consciousness
	Unconscious / Breathing
		place in recovery position
		monitor breathing

Appearance of drowning casualty

LG scans area looking for hazards or people needing assistance

Understanding how people look when drowning is important to improve speed of rescue and recovery & survival

drowning - many reasons
	weak to non
	HA
	injury

Non-Swimmer
	cannot swim
	in deep water cannot keep head above water
	survival depends on - health, fitness, injury, abilty 
	unrespionsive to calls
	unable to help themselves	

Weak Swimmer
	fatigued or poor swimming 
	cannot reach point of saftey/support
	
	may be able to
		wave/call for help
		respond to instruction
		cooperate when support is offered
		rescue them selves

	likely to be at an angle in water

Swimmer - medical emergency
	depends on nature, type, severity of medical 999
	
	minor - may be responsive/able to help themselves
	serious - could be unresponsiveness
	
	Act quickly 
		swimmer with 999 can turn into non-swimmer very quickly

	Asthma attack
	heart attack
	angina attack
	stroke
	diabetic 999
	seizure

Unconscious Casualty
	behaviour or position that is not normal should be investigated

	face down - arms/legs limp
	totally limp in water
	between surface /bottom of pool
	small movements - seizure type actions
	may remain in same position before they went unconscious
		swimming position
		resting at edge/lane rope

What should you look for

	face and eyes show panic
	no expression
	gulps of air
	lifting their arms
	floating
	not using arms/legs
	upright body position
	not calling for help
	head tilted back
	float face down


SIMPLE STUDY

	To look at appearance of drowning casualty

AIM OF STUDY

	evaluate behaviour and actions of casualty drowning
	or suffering medical episode that inhobits ability to swiim

	enhance RLSS UK training

	improve pool su[pervision

	save lives

PROCESS

	footage from 10 incidents
		drowning/medical episode

	From list of behaviours

		identify behaviour on list
		identify behaviours NOT on list

	BEHAVIOURS			  IDENTIFIED
Vertical in water				6
not shouting/calling				10
head out of water in early stages		4
Bobbing up/down					2
push arms down/resurface/gasping for air	2
head tilted back				1
sinking/arms over head				1
fighting to get to surface			3

Behaviours identified not in list

	Sudden sinking to bottom, no struggle	3
	shaking/jerking				2
	appear to continue swim under water	2
	rotate body				2

Many incidents occur at end of swimming lane 40%

OUTCOME

Very few similarities in actions of casualties who are 
	drowning/medical episode

LIFEGUARDS 
	trained 
	prepared to look for abnormal behavior
	investigate

IF SWIMMER NOT ACTING NORMALLY OR YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT TO THEIR
ACTIONS YOU MUST INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY

NPLQ

drowning non-swimmers priority is to breathe
lots of variations to how non-swimmers behave

Vertical in water
not shouting/calling
head out of water in early stages
Bobbing up/down			
push arms down/resurface/gasping for air
head tilted back			
sinking/arms over head			
fighting to get to surface		
submerged and not returning to surface

IF SWIMMER NOT ACTING NORMALLY OR YOU ARE IN ANY DOUBT TO THEIR
ACTIONS YOU MUST INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY


RECONSTRUCTION

	casulaty tries to swim distance under water
		takes breath and blacks out

	pushes from wall / shakes while sinking to bottom

	swims to wall / has heart issue
	cant stay at surface
	vertical in water near wall

	competant swimmer, suddenly stops
	turns face down
	cant get oxygen

	from swimmer to weak swimmer very quickly
	struggle to stay at surface
	then sink to bottom
	
	from swimmer to non swimmer very quickly
	then sink to bottom
	has some form of siezure

ERC 2015 Guidelines	

	CPR
		look listen feel - NO more than 10 sec
		if any doubt that breathing is normal
			act as though not breathing normally
			start CPR immediately

	LIFEGUARDING
		
		IF SWIMMER NOT ACTING NORMALLY OR YOU ARE IN ANY 
		DOUBT TO THEIR ACTIONS YOU MUST INVESTIGATE IMMEDIATELY

Accountability

	were you effective or ineffective during an incident

	your actions will impact on the development and outcome of an emergency

	outcomes are not always successful even with the best supervision and response 
		but LG must always act professionally and in accordance with training

	after an incident an investigation follows and the actions of the LG will be first thing investigated

	LG talking to public, not observing pool
	LG looking unprofessional by leaning casually on railings
	LG distracted by personal phone and not observing pool
	LG not following training and NOP

Entering the water

	always entry the water safely
	always follow NOP and diving rules

	regular practice during training on entering water safely
	includes getting off high chair - must never lose site of casualty (crowded pools)
	
	ALWAYS enter water with torpedo bouy
	
	SLIDE IN
		slide in and maintain eye contact with casualty
		knees slightly bent
		used in shallow or deep pools
		or where there is a drop to pool level
		useful in wave sessions
	
	STEP / WALK IN
		used in shallow pool or pool with beach area

	STRADDLE
		keeps casualty in view
		keeps head out of water
		can used with torpedo bouy
		NOT in crowded pool
		NOT from above 1m
	
		eyes on casualty keep chin up
		step out
		knees slight bent
		one leg forward one leg back
		arms sidways palms down
		on entry close legs in scissor action and push arms down

		hold torpedo bouy across chest and hold straps to avoid tangling
	
	SHALLOW DIVE

			  signs in car park or in reception
		if theres immenient risk to live LG should reduce numebr of people in pool immediately
		LG should be trained in crowd management
	LG role
		follow training to ensure communications are followed
			eg call out swimmers who have been in for a certain time 
				manage safe reduction in numbers

		a color band system will help with this

		take care not move problem into other areas eg changing areas

		Communicate with supervisor that loads are nearing capacity
		Restrict / stop entry into the pool
		request support from additional LG/Suppervisors to assist in reducing no of bathers

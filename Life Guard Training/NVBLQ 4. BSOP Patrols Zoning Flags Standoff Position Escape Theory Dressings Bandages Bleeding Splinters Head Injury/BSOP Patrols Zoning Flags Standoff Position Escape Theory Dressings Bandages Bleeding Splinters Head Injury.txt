		patrol zone
			area u r responsible for
			make zone easy to see so users
			know where is best to use water
		public info boards
			explains flags
			placed at entrance of beach
		4 international flags

	chequered	water sports/no swimmers
	solid red	conditions to dangerous for swim
	red/yellow	safe area/LG patrol between flags
	wind sock	direction/strength of wind
		
	red & yellow
		LG on duty
			give advice		
			first aid
			find lost children
			use rescue skills
		2 r&y flags at water edge 
			safest place for swimming/body board/inflat
		make sure doesnt contain
			rip currents
			hidden holes

	red
		danger
		conditions are to dangerous to swim
		team not able to preform rescue

Patrol Methods
	small amount of beach users

	BSOP - beach safety op proced
		min no of LGs for beach
		may be only 2
	patrol metghods used depends on
		no of users
		environmental conditions
		activitoes
	
	between the flags patrol
		identify safest area
		2 R&Y flags placed 
		rescue equipment kept in area
		LG restricts swimmers
		supervis closely	
	Roving Patrol
		large beach
		pait of LG can supervise areas outside flagged area
		LG move between agreed points
		use quads,4WD,inflatable rescue boats for large area		Outpost Patrol
		small less popular area away from main beach
		small patrol to cover area
	Surveillance
		small no of users
		2 LG must provide service

Setting Up A Partol
	team decides
		safety of chosen patrol area
		most approp patrol method
		allocation of equip/LG
		specifi actions needed to ensure user safety

	Using Patrols
		general
			size/distance of area
			no of visitors
			skill level of visitors
			type of activity
			equip used - inflatables etc
			hazards - rocks/drop offs
			no of LGs
			LG equip
			other tasks LG team has to do
			facilities that LG can use
			saftey/emergency servcies available
			communication systems - for support/999
			Senior LG/patrol capt
				brief LGs on roles/responsibilities
		beach
			type
			weather/sea conditions
			entry points
			public facilities
		equipment
			LG ensure emergency equip is in place
			equip in working order

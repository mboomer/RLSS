Since Generation 9 of NPLQ all LGs are required an assessment
	basic use of AED
	regardless of whether pool operator has an AED on site
	check with employer if you need a stand alone AED cert
	may need an additional assessment/training along with NPLQ cert
	

Automated External Defibrillators (AED)

	majority of cardiac arrests are due, initially,
		abnormal/fast/iregular beat of heart
		tgis is called ventricular fibrillation (VF)
		electrical defibrillation is well establish as only 
		effective treatment

	AED is device that deleivers controlled elcetrica shock to terminat VF
	AED analyses heart rhythm to see if it is shockable
	AED uses voice prompts to guide users
	AED syitable for lay people/healthcare providers
	AED majority are semi-automatic & prompt user to deleiver shock by 
	pressing a button
	
	Fully automated AED will deliver shock with no interventionf from user
	if it detects the heart rhythm is shockable

	
	x-axis - time take from collapse to shock being administered
	y-axis - % chance of survival

	The delay from collapse to first shock is most important determinant
	of survival

	prompt - survival as high as 75% 
	survival chanes declines by 10% for each minute of delay
	
	CPR helps maintain a shockable rhythm
	but is not the definitive treatment

	Having AED on premises and a trained team helps keep time take to 
	treat a casualty to a minimum

	It is now cost effective to have an AED on site

Chain Of Survival

	Early Recognition
	Early CPR
	Early Defib		- gives cauualty the best chaicne of survival
				- must be retrieved quickly
	Post resuscitation care

Terminology

	Cardiac Arrest
		heart stops pumping blood around body
		blood flow to brain is reduced to zero
		can cause siezures (may be confused with epliepsy)	
		assess for normal breathing once seizure is over
	Agonal Gasps
		in first few minutes casualty may be taking 
		infrequent, slow, noisy gasps (like snoring)
		
		An indication to start CPR immediately

Airway Management
	detecting that casualty is breathing normally will determine what 
	course of action to take

	effective airway management can increase chance of survival
		effective rescue breaths
	key steps are
		head tilt/chin lift
		look at chest
		listen for breathing
		feel for breathing
		mist be for 10 secs
		

	CPR flow chart - Adult Child & Infant

		summary of actions to take during primary survey
		doesnt take every step required
		  dosnt say...check for breathing using head tilt/chin lift
		  step 2 - does say that an AED should be brought immediately

	Unresponsive & not breathing
	call 999 / ask for ambulance
	if drowning child/infant - 5 rescue breaths
	30 chest comps
	2 rescue breaths
	continue 30 cc - 2 rb
	as soon as  AED arrives - switch on and folow instructions

CPR in action

	while waiting for AED may have to start CPR

Locations of AEDs that public may be able to use in emergency

	Airports
	train stations
	shopping centers
	leisure centers
	public libraries
	telephone boxes
	community centers
	churches
	

Guideliones for using AED

	if AED not immediately available - Start CPR immediately
	continue until AED arrives

	If AED available, use it without delay

	if > 1 LG present
		continue CPR while AED is switched on
	if alone, Stop CPR and switch on AED
	follow voice prompts/visual prompts
	Attach pads to bare chest
	No-one touches caualty while AED is analysing heart rhythm
	
Where to place pads on adult casualty
	
	May vary slightly
	know what model at site recomends
	
	top of chest
	lower opposite side of chest
	
	work as a team when placign pads to avoid interrupting CPR
	LG1 continues CPR while LG2 sets up AED
	LG2 should be assertive with instructions
	
	When shock is indicated
		no-one touches the casualty
		issue verbal commands
		use arms/hands as visual aid to indicate LG1 should move away
	push shiock button as directed
	
	A fully automated AED will deliver shick automatically

	Once delivered - resume CPR with chest compessions as guided by
	voice prompts from AED

	LG should minimise interruption to chest compressions
	
	if no shock is indicated by AED, resume CPR with 30-2 ratio

	COntinue as direcetd by voice/visual prompts

	COntinue until
		health professional tells you to stop
		You become exhausted
		casualty is definetly waking up/miving/opening eyes
		& breathinh normally

	
Placement of AED pads

	chest must suficiently exposed to place the electrode pads
	chest hair may interfere
		only shave if haior is excessive and be spend as little 
		time as possible
	Dont wait if no razor is available
	
	Most AED have pics of where to pplace pads
	its not vital if positions are reversed
	dont correct an error of placement as pads may not stick when moved
	
	if skin is wet - wipe skin dry before placing pads

	PaceMaker
		visible below left collor bone
		if rarely on right place pads beside/below it

	Medication Patches
		remove to avoid sparking/burns during defib

	AED FLowchart

		unresponsive/not breathing
		call 999/ambulance
		
			AED --- no ------> 30cc-2rb
			 |
			yes
			 |----- turn on/follow visual/voie prompts

Safety COnsiderations

	Use Of Oxygen
	
	if casualty is getting oxygen via face mask
		remove mask
		place >= 1 meter away
		reduces risk of spark igniting
		but dont let this get in way of giving shock

	dont touch casualy during analysis, charging, shock
		movements can intefer with AeD detecting rhythm
		call stand clear and check no-one is close by or touches casualt
	
	You can use AED on spinal injury, on or off rescue boaard
	everyone must stand clear when instructed by the AED
	this incldues the LG providing manual inline stabilisation of head

Using AED in swimming pool (wet casualty)

	as long as no-one is touching casualty when shock is delivered there is
	no danger to rescuer/casualty, even if on a wet surface

	if casusalty chest is wet, dry this before applying pads

	AED has imerrision protection rating
		shows if AED can be used ina wet environment
		operator will check the AED is suitable for pool environment

USe of AED with child/infant

	Standard adult AED pads are suitable for use with children > 8 yrs

	special pediatric pads reduce curent during defib
	should be sued for infants / children

	if no pediatric pads available - use the AED as it is

	if casualty is so small that adult pads cannot be placed in 
	standard chest positions without touching
		one pad on the upper front of the chest
		one pad on corresponding position on back
	different models vary
		LG needs training on using the model at their pool for
		children/infants
		and location of pediatric pads

What should be stored with an AED

	Small towel/flannel
	razor
	pocket mask
	protective gloves
	scissors
	spare pads
	pediatric pads
	spare battery/batteries

AED Checks

	regular checks include
		readiness for use -indicator/green flashing light

	EQuipment present
	
	Small towel/flannel
	razor
	scissors
	pocket mask
	pads
		
Managing Regurgitation

	may occuring during CPR/using AED

	Stomach contents amy enter airways/lungs

	can cause breathing problems/pneumonia

	turn on to side to allow regurgitation to flow out of mouth
		
Recovery Position

	prevents tingue falling back to block airways
	reduce risk of regurgitated stomach contents blocking airways

	unconscious casulty with airways clear and breathing normally

	unless suffering suspected spinal injury

	make sure breathing is normal and NOT return of agonal gasps

	steps

		knee by side
		raise arm closest
		opposite hand to side of face closest to you
		raise opposite knee
		keep hand by face
		roll towards you
		place knee to support body
		tilt head down and forward

CPR injury to spine

	if injury to spine is suspected
		a fall
		blow to head
		diving into shallow water

	take care to align head/neck/chest
	vital to have support/assistance from other team members

	if casualty has been rescued to point of stability
	and is not breathing normally, urgent removal is required using 
	rescue board or horizontal spinal lift

	if casualty breathjing stops/becomes abnormal
	while secured on board - start CPR immediately, includes use of 
	AED while casualty is on rescue board/PXB

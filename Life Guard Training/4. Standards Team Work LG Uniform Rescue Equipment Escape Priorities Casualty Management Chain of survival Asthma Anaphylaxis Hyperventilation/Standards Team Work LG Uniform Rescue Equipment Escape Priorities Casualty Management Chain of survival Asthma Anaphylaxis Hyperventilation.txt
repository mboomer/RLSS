Maintaining standards

	LG standards must always be maintained
	failure to do so can comprise safety standards and potentially put people in danger
	You are personally for maintaining standards
	Public safety is in your hands

	Other than LG who else can help in an emergency
		Other LG's who may be of shift/rotation
		on duty First Aiders
		swim teachers with rescue award
		managers/supervisors
		receptionists/gym instructors/cleaners
		off duty doctor/nurse/paramedic
		other emergency responders

Working as a Team

	Having other well trained staff is essential for 
		emergencies
		day to day operation

	gives you confidence you can put a casualty first during a rescue
	consistency in how pool rules/supervision of swimmers is applied
	
	Team Work examples

	in rescues
		an assisted lift
		horizontal support
		CPR
LG Uniform

	LG needs correct kit
		uniform
		whistle
		basic FA equipment
		suitable rescue aid eg torpedo bouy

	Uniform should not hinder LG in a rescue
	shorts & T-shirt
	red & yellow - internationally recognised colours for LGs
		easily recognised so public can identify LG 
	
	being smart & presentatable is part of maintaining standards and giving right impression to public

Jewellery

	anything that may cause injury during a rescue should be removed
		e.g earings bractelets watches etc
		    body piercings can be hazards and should be covered on duty

Mobile Phones/SmartTech

	NEVER take on to poolside, changing rooms, surrounding areas
	
	Can be an uncessary distraction meaning LG could miss an incident or an opportunity to prevent 
	an incident from occuring

Pool Rescue Equipment

	Rescue board - spinal board 
	PXB - Pool extraction board
	reach pole
	torpedo bouy

	Pool operator will decide which equipment is needed depending on
		pool type
		session type
		circumstances
	
	Torpedo bouy is one of most versatile
		reaching
		throwing
		wading
		swimming

	Torpedo Bouy
	throw bags
	boutyant throwing devices
	reaching poles

	RLSS does not recommend the use of coiled ropes

Personal Safety during rescues

	Defensive block
	Separating multiple casualties
	Escapes from grasps

	RLSS recommends entering the water with a Torpedo Bouy when possible

	Defensive block
		use torpedo bouy to block casualy from grabbing you
		causalty will immediately grab the bouy
		this gives them bouyancy and will help calm them
		risk to LG is always kept to a minimum
	Principles
		using both hands push bouy in to swimmers chest
		casualty grabs bouy
		distance yourself by holding the strap
		comminicate and reassure them
		tow to a safe point of support or exit point
	
	General principles of escape

		RLSS UK recommends using Torpedo bouy where suitable
		this reduces liklihood of needing escapes

		if LG eneters water without bouyancy aid when dealing with panicking casualty

		hold breath
		tick chin into chest, protect throat
		submerge
		push against them with legs/arms
		try and relsae their grip
		once free move to safe distance
		assess situation and rescue with team support
				
	Separating multiple casualties

	Dangerous situations develop when a weak swimmer is out of their depth and starts to panic
	they may grab the nearest person and cause a multiple casualty incident
	
	if torpose bouys arent available (unlikely)
	you must separate 2 casualties who are clinging to one another

	grasp uppermost under arm pits from behind
	force both underwater
	place legs around first
	put feet against hips/thighs of second
	maintaining grip on first casualty - use legs to push second apart
	once free move to safe distance
	assess situation and rescue using team support

Disorderly Behaviour

	occurs in variety of forms
		users acting agressively to other users/staff
	
	always following training set out by employer

	EAP outlines how to deal with threats/violence
	in addition to your safety you should consider others
		may need to clear pool (1 long blast)
	
	Examples
		Physical 
		threats
		violence to staff
		sexual assualt

	YOUR ROLE in this situation

		follow your training - ensure all levels of communication are followed
		know the procedure in EAP for managing victims, friends relatives
		EAP states who, when and how emergency services are contacted
		complete accident/incident report

Casualty Management - Chain of Survival

	Priorities of casualty management

	Brain is most sensitive part of our body - it must have oxygen
	if the heart stops no blood pumps around the body so no oxygen is carried to brain
	within seconds a casualty will lose conciousness 
	with a few minutes the casualty will die

	Start CPR immediately after someones heart stops and they have stopped breathing is vital
	
	EAP sets out how an emergency is managed but in a resusitation emergency there are
	priorities that always apply

	ABC
		AIRWAYS		ensure airway is open
		BREATHING	look/listen for breathing
		CIRCULATION	start chest compressions

	life thtreatening emergencies must be managed first and take priority over other injuries

	priority is

		emergency CPR
		management of choking
		control life threatening bleeding
		care of unconscious but breathing casualty
		treatment for shock
		medication attention
	
	although severe bleeding is rare, there are occasions when stoppping significant blood 
	loss should done before starting CPR

	CHAIN OF SURVIVAL

	keys stages in life support - 4 inter-related steps
	if delivered effectively and in sequence optimise survival from out of hospital arraest

	early recognition
	early CPR
	early (EAD) defibrilation
	post resusitation care

Turning a casualty from front to back

	kneel by casualty side
	turn casualties head so it faces away from you
	place arm nearest you above their head
	with one hand grab far shoulder and with out clamp wrist to their hip
	roll over against your thighs
	lower gently on to back, supporting head/shoulders
	place arms down by their sides
	be careful but as quick as possible

Asthma Attack

	LG may to deal with a variety of breathing difficulties

	occurs when muscles in airways spasm and narrow
		muscus in airway causes shortness of breath/wheezing
	may start sudddenly and pass quickly
	people with asthma usually carry medication

	dont accept responsibility for keeping inhalers or other medication

	Signs/Symptoms

		breathing difficult
		wheezy breathlessness
		anxiety
		difficulty speaking
		pale clammy grey or blue lips (cyanosis)

	Treatment

		reassure them
		sit in comfortable position
		encourage to use their medication
		children may need extra help (spacer device)
		repeat inhaler if attack continues
		remove from cause - dusty room, fumes etc.
		cold winter air may make attack worse
	
	call 999/112 if
		casualty goes unconscious
		an attack is severe
		attack lasts longer than normal
		medication doesnt help
		person is distressed or exhausted

Anaphylaxis

	serious potentially fatal condition caused by severe allergic reaction

	triggers
		foods, nuts etc
		insect bites
		stings
		medication
		latex

	Signs/Symptoms

		swollen tongue
		hoarse voice
		difficulty swallowing
		difficult or noisey breathing
		wheeze/cough
		abdominal pain/nasuea/vomiting
		swelling of hands/feet/face/skin
		red itchy rash/rasied areas on skin
		widespread flushing
		anxiety/panic/feeling of terror

	Treatment

		ask for their injector/epi pen etc
			an adrelenine auto injector administered in upper thigh

		casualty should administer themselves
		parent/guardian will assist a child
		call 999/112 even if improvement occurs after injection
		tell operator the person is suffering from anaphylaxis and needs paramedics

		Casualty may want to sit up if they are having breathing difficulties
		if they feel faint, then lie them down and raise their legs

		call 999/112 if condition deteriorates
			follow up call to make sure ambulance is on way

		administer second dose if no improvement in 5-10 minutes or if symptoms re-cccur

		monitor and prepare for CPR if required

		an unconscious casualty who is breathing normally can be put in recovery position
			monitor until emergency services arrive
		
		Using an adrelenine auto injector needs training
			speak to employer about training

HyperVentilation

	excessive breathing
		can be result of panic attack
		swimmer deep breathing before swimming under water
		novice swimmer 

	does not improve oxygen in blood
		reduces cardon dioxide which reduces desire to breath
		physical activity uses up remaining oxygen
		shallow water blackout
			swimmer runs out of oxygen and loses consciousness 
			before feeling the need to breath again
	
	Signs & Symptoms
		dizziness/feeling faint
		cramp
		tight chest
		panic
		rapid pulse
		unnatural fast deep breathing
		flushed skin

	treatment

		move to quiet area away from others
		reassure them - be calm but firm
		encourage to take slow breaths through nose
		small sips of water
		call 999/112 if attack is prolonged

	preventation is best
		discourgae distance swimming under water
		warn users associated from hyperventilation
		discourage people from repeatedly diving to bottom of pool

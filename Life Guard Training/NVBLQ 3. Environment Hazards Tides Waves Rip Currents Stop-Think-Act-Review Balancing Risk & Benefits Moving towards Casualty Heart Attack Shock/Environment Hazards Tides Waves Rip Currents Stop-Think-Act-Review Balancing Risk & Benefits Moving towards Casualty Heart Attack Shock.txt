Environment Hazards

	Weather
		can vary from hour to hour
		turns a safe beach into a dangerous beach
		check local weather forecast
		
	Wind
		may change depending on weather
		onshore offshore
		strength & direction - affect safety
		wind affects waves
	
		offshore
			blows from beach to sea
			dangerous for inflatables
			waves - clean glassy
			advise people not to go in if strong offshore wind

		onshore
			from sea to land
			break wave surface. choppy surf conditions
			check direction of flags

	Sea Breeze
		warm sunny day, no wind - sea breeze may develop
		land warms up, heats air above
		air rises and cool air from see rushes in
		daytime - onshore
		
		as land cools down - reverse happens
		offshore
	
	Sea mist & fog
		can see before it reaches shore
		banks of mist/fog on horizon
		warm air passes over cool air - gets mositure
		reduce visibility
		disorientated / lose bearings

	Storms
		can be seen moving towards beach
		consider risk to users
			red flags
			advise users to leave
		be vigilant at al times
		electrical storms are expevially dangerous
		lightning - major threat to people in water
	
		30-30 rule
		flash to bang < 30secs - 10km away
		risk of lightning strike - RED FLAG the beach

		re-open - 30mins after last lightning strike 

	Estimating wind strength
		beaufort scale
			strength/speed
			13 point scale
		estimates
			wind speed in knots/mph/kph
			wave height

							breaking crests
							foam streaks

							dense foam streaks
10	storm (stm)	48-55	55-63	88-101	9.0	very high		trees uprooted
							surface is white	more structural damage
11	violent stm	56-63	64-73	102-117	11.5	exceptionally high	widespread damage
							hides small boats
12	hurricane	>64	>74	>119	>14	foan & spray		widespread damage
							sea white
					
	Tides
		movement of body of water
		makes sea rise and fall
		
		flooding - tide in
				high water
		ebbing - tide out
				low water

	Hieght
		gravity sun/moon
		lunar month
			2 spring tides
			2 neap tides
			every 7 days
		between  neap -> spring
			tide increase each day to reach spring
			redcues to reach neap
		Spring Tide
			sun moon earth line up
			high tides higher
			low tises lower
		Neap tide
			sun moon at right angles
			1st 3rd quarter
			high tides lower
			low tisdes higher
		
		Strong winds
		low pressure - increase >1m

	Tide Table
		2 high and 2 low every 24 hours
		varies - large harbour nearby
	
		each tide 
			6hrs to flood
			6hrs to ebb
		 delay between flood/ebb is called slack water
		means times change every day
	Speed
		floods slowly
		speeds up
		slows down at high tide
		reverse for ebbing tide
		
		rule of 12ths
			50% of tides move in 3rd & 4th hour

		Hour 1 - inc 1 12th
		Hour 2 - inc 2 12ths
		Hour 3 - fastest 3 12ths / hour
		HOur 4		
		Hour 5 - slows incs 2 12ths
		Hour 6 - inc 1 12th
				slack water
				reverse
		How far up/down beach depends on slope
		shallow - floods more quickly
		deep - water doesnt come in as far
	
	Waves
		what causes wave
			wind
			how long it blows / how hard it blows
		as wve hits shallows they break
		the bigger the wave period 
			wave crest to wave crest
			the easier it is to paddle /swim

		still water line - level if sea was flat
		crest - highest part above still water line
		trough - lowest part below still water line	
		height - (crest - trough)
		length - crest -> crest (time)

	Types of waves

	how wave breaks - slope/shape of ground

	Spilling
		crest tumbles face of wave
		safest
		gently sloping beachs
		good swimming/board riders
	Plunging/Dumpers
		break suddenly
		powerful - dangerous
		steep sloping beaches
		crest faster than base
		curls over
		crashes violently ito trough

		huge force throw swimmer to bottom
		injury
		knock off feet
		backwash may drag out
	Surging
		may never break
		very steep sloping beaches/rocks
		dont slow down
		dont get higher
		strong bcakwash
		knock off feet, carry out to deep water

	Rip Currents
		from shore out to sea
		water builds on beach
		estuary
		feeder current
			water flows along beach/feeder channels
			finds easiest path bcak to sea
		neck
			flows away from beach
			strongest current
		head
			past teh surf zone
			current spreads out
			into shoaling zone

		are unpredictable/can sweep out to sea
		casues panic
		may suddenly be taken out to sea
	
		how to identify
			look for debris/foam on surface
			floating away from beach
			sand/seaweed churning in water
			discolour water
			no waves in rip/break either side
		How to escape
			inform what to if they get caught in rip
			stay calm / thonk clearly
			swim out with teh current
			swim out parrall with shore
			swim to shore
			float/tread water
				when out of rip 
				then swim to shore
			if you canreach shore
				float on back
				face shore
				signal for help - raise 1 arm

	STOP THINK ACT REVIEW

	incidents - usually on busy beaches
	be prepared to take emerg action in water and on shore

	take time to assess what is happening
	review all options
	lessons from rpevious rescues
	
	STOP
		where is casualty
		whats wriong
		call for help LG/public
		look for rescue aids
	THINK
		how will reach
		what equip needed
		what dangers
		how will you rescue
		where will you take them
		what treatment
		do you need mroe help
	ACT
		carry out rescue
		medical treatment/first aid
		get more help
	REVIEW
		record
		how to stop hapening in future
		what would u do differently
			use of equip
			first aid


	RISK / BENEFITS PRIOR TO RESCUE
			
	YOU
	YOUR TEAM
	CASUALTY
	CASUALTIES EQUIP

	Balancing risk/benefit	 
			
	before risking your saftey
		decide how sucessful rescue is likely to be
			
	think about hazrads / potential risks
	
	make plan to reduce risk for you/team/casualty

	high risk - low benefit --> NO GO
	risk high - benefit high --> adapt paln to reduce risk
	risk low - benefit high --> rescue with caution

	risk med - benefit med --> adapt plan - reduce rsik

	Moving towars a casualty

	conscious/distressed casualty sees u as someone who 
	will provide help & floatation

	take control
	contact zone - highest risk
		casualty can grab and hold on
		stops them swimming
		both could drown
	stay 2m away until ready to put plan into action
	shouldnt rescue without equip
	always put barrier between yourself and casualty
	
Heart Attack
	interruption of blood supply to heart
	blocked blood vessel
	heart muscle starved of oxygen

	Recognition
	
	Symptoms
		dizziness/nausea
		crushing/tighening in chest
		tingling/pain in left arm - jaw, other areas
		indegestion
		rapid/weak irregular pulse
		impending doom
		anxiety
	Signs
		pale grey skin
		coughing
		blue tingle skin/lips
		sweaty skin
		difficulty breathing
		clutching chest
		Sudden collapse
	Treatment
		Call 999/112
		sit in comfortable position (half sitting)
		loosen clothing neck/waist
		ask about medical conditions/medication
		reassure
		remove any casue of streess/anxiety
		monitor	
		prepare for CPR if stops breathing

		NOTE: 	slowly chewing 1 aspirin 300mg is benefitial
			get tablet for them
			check if allergic
Shock
	failure of circulation
		leads to inadequate supply of blood to organs
	
	Causes
		low blood volume - bleeding (hypovolemic shock)
		loss of body fluids
			vomiting/diarrheos/burms/dehydration
		low cardiac output
			not enough blood pumped round body
			cardiogenic shock

	recognition
	symptoms
		dizziness
		confusion
		disorientated
		nauseous
		thirsty
	Signs
		pale cold clammy skin
		blue lips
		weak rapid pulse
		rapid shallow breathing
		unconscious

		body tries to compensate by diverting blood 
		to vital organs

	Treatment
		assist to lie down
		raise legs f possible/injuries
		treat cause of the shock
		reassure
		keep warm
		monitor
		no food / drink
		call 999/112

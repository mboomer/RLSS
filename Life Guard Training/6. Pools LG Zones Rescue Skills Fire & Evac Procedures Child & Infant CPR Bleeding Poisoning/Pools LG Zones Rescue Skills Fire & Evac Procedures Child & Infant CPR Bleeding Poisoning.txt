Types of Pools

	No one type of pool
	vary on shape & size
	complex free form
	flumes/wave makers
	
	whatever type the LG job is to make sure users are safe

	Leisure pool
		flumes
		slides 
		waves
		lazy river

	Diving Pools
		may be separate from main pool
		deep watre up to 5m deep
		diving platforms at various hieghts
		1m / 3m/ 5m / 10m

	Competition / Traditional Pools
		25m
		diving blocks - galas
		27-30 deg
		
	Health Clubs
		smaller pools
		shallower
		usually higher temp
		may be members only/adults only
	Outdoor/Lidos
		can be vey large long 50-100m wide 25m
		deep water
		some heated / others cold
		caravan park / holiday camp / near sea

Details of the pool

	design will affect the no of LGs needed
	and how they carry out LG duties
	Your pool will identify hazards / risks / LG pisitions

	bigger pools have more people so more difficult to observe everyone
	So each LG will have a specific area - ZONE
	So multiple LGs arent watching the same area at same time

	traditional pools - rectanglur
	leisure/hotel pools  irregular 
		hazrads - walls / pillars/ split levels /jacuzis / vegatation

	Profile - gente slopes are safer than steep steps

Life Guard ZONE

	Area of pool LG is responsible for supervising

	scanning pattern may vary due to
		design / shape
		type of session - fun / inflatables / lessons
	user load - higher numbers means more LGs

	LGVT
		Life Guard Visibility Test
	
	dont deviate from training given on PSOP
	moving from your zone/position could mean LG is unable to spot/stop an incident happening
	No of LGs determined by risk assessment
		
	Zones detailed in NOP
	displayed at each LG station
	may be parts of pool or specific activity
		swim lesson zone
		recreational area
		around inflatables/fun session
		around diving boards / flumes / waves

	ZONES
		differ in shapes and sizes
		following flow of water in river feature
		if river goes outside building more LGs will be needed
	CATEGORIES
		shared zones
			LG may cover full pool if risk assessment deams sthis suitable
			if risk assessment says 2 LGs are needed each LG will cover half the pool
			or maybe that both LGs cover whole pool
		
		individual zones
			know the boundaries of your zone
			so no area is left unsupervised
			use physical features to mark zones
			reach any casualty within 20 secs
	LG zone - defined in NOP
	coberd in inductoon and on-going training
	maybe laminated zone cards at each LG position
		Activity
		NO of LGs
		area of pool and zone
		specific hazarads / rules / control measures

Rescue Skills

	Turning unconscious casualty 
		immediate intervention is essential
		if on pool surface turn face up
			push one shoulder down
			raise otehr shoulder in smooth motion
			roll body face up
			support back and chin as move into towing position
	approaching submerged casualty
		swim underwater to deepest part of pool

	feet first surface dive
		enter safely
		swim to casualty
		tread water breaststroke/egg beater kick - press down with hands to raise out of water
		legs together - arms by side
		as you go under sweep arms upward
		at bottom tuck/pike
		hold casualty under armpits
		push off bottom

	head first surface dive
		enter water safely
		bend at waist
		head between arms
		lift legs out of water
		use breast stroke to swim down
		hold casualty under armpits
		push off bottom
	deep dive
		dive from pool side
		water must be 2m 
		follow diving rules
		ensure no users in way
		dive at steep angle / may need to swim under water
			ensure secvure standing position
			look down & forward
			bend knees and push off
			throw arms forward
			enter water pointing towards casualty
			hold casualty under armpits
			push off bottom
			use free arm to wim to surface
	swimming under water
		essential
		typically do breatstroke
		pressure in water > 1.5m can cause middle ear / ear drum and sinuses
			hold nose and blow gently
			breath thru nose
			swallowing
			move jaw / chewing motion
		may need to tell employer if LG is sussecptiable to ear/nose/throat conditions
	multiple casualties

Fire & Evacuation Procedures

	Role - understand your role in event of fire
		how to mange controlled evacation
		direct users to assembly points outside (meeting point signs)
		pay attention to children / swimming lessons / less able swimmers
	keep fire exits clear and follow training to ensure all levels of communication are followed

	EMPLOYER - sets out

	how to raise alarm
	fire alarm / call points
	controlled evacation of building
	evacation of users
	assembly points
	managing pool users & young children
	how to manage a swimming lesson & children
	evacuation of disabled swimmers
	contacting 999
	staff roles
	access & arrival of emergency servcies
	
Child & INfant CPR

	infact - < 1 year old
	child > 1 to puberty
		no need to establish puberty - if you beleiev casualty is a child follow child guidelines
	Similar to adult but modified
	rare for heary to stop
	airways/breathing are more common - which can lead to cardiac arrest
	so essential to make sure airway is clear

		inhalation of stomach contents
		regurgation of food
		swallowing toy/peanut
	drowning
	infection (croup) lungs pneumonia
	injury - head/neck/chest
	
	chest compressions 1/3 of depth
	ask someone to call 999
	ask for AED
	give 5 reasue breaths
	use 2 fingers - infant
	use one hand - child

	if on own do CPR for 1miute before going for help

	child / infant
		ask someone to call 999 have unconscoous child/infact and am starting CPR
		ask for them to bring AED
		
		5 breaths
		30 compressions
		2 breaths
		30 compressions
	
BLeeds

	Venous
	Arterial
	Capillary
	
	external from cut
	internal from blow/inury
	
	blood loss reduces oxygen to organs
	severe bleeding can cause shock - ultimately death
	
	Artery
		spurts out - severed artery can lead to rapid blood loss - shock/death
	Veins
		ooze out
	capillaries
		trickle - small cust/grazes
	
	Types of Wounds
		bruise / contusion
		graze / abrazion
		cut/slice - incision
		rip/tear - laceration
		stabbing - puncture
		gun shot

Poisoning
	anything that enters your body - solid / liquid / gas

		plant room / chemical store
	
	Symptoms
		difficulty breathing
		dizzy
		nauseous	
		abdominal pain
		confusion
		head ache
	Sign
		evidence - chemical, drugs, medication. food
		unusal smell - gases
		vomiting
		burns/swelling

	if unconscious
		check breathing normally
		reciovery position
		monitor breathing
	call 999
	if CPR needed - use face mask (barrier resuscition)
	collect info on poison and pass to 999

	Gas/Chemical Leak
		call 999 and fire brigage in accordance with EAP
		999/ fire brigade need to be told what type of fumes/checmicals were involved
	
	CLosed Space
		if casualty in closed space and LG suspects poisonious fumes	
		do not attempt rescue without breathing apparatus for LG and team
		you must be trained in use of breathing apparatus

	must have support support from other team memebers
	open doors/windows for ventilation
	make sure this does not put otehrs at risk

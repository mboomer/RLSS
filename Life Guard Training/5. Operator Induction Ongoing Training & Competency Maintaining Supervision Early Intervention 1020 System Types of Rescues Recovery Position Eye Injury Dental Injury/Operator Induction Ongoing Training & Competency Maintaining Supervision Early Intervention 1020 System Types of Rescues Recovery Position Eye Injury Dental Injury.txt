Ovservation / Supervision

	Supervision: 
		directing activities to control how a user behaves
	Observation:
		watching activity - no direct action
	LG needs a balance so people enjoy their visit

Early Intervention and acident perventation

	report potential hazards
	supervising pool users
	intervene asap to prevent dangerous activity/accident occuring

	early intervention is better than rescue

	ask swimmer not to hyper ventilate
	ask to follow direction of swim lanes
	stop weak swimmer from going in deep end
	act immediately if see pained experssion

	You can prevent an accident

	follow and apply PSOP
	observe &supervise
	educate users on rules & safety e.g no diving

	LG may need to leave position to intervene
	LG must remain at position unless making an intervention to prevent accident/manage situation/respond to emergency

	LG Should
		intervene to prevent accident/manage situation/respond to emergency

	Critical
		life in danger
		follow EAP immediately
	Non-critical
		accident could happen
		events lead to something more serious

		deal with user, clear instruction to stop

		If you have to leave position - LG must return to posititon as soon as possible
		if LG cannot return to position immediately - summon backup - time frame may be statted in NOP


10:20 System

	clear any debris from mouth
	turn on to back
	restablish airway

Recovery position

	An unconscious cauualty breathing normally should be turned in recovery position (unless spinal injury suspected)

The Beach Environment and Hazards

	Hazard - something that may casue harm
	control measure - what you do to make likely an incident will happen

	natural
		
	man-made
			
	people	
			

	most important to recognise hazarsd and put effective control 
	measures in place to stop harm to users
	acting early to prevent harm is key to effective LG service

	have good knowledge of beach and any hazrads
	
	risk of harm when people and hazrads come into contact
	beach environ always changes - dangers can change quickly
	hazards can have stronger effect when combined
		inflatables & off-shore winds
	
	NATURAL
	Sandy beach
		gentle slope/shelving - safest beach
		tides can come in very fast
	Shingle/pebble
		steep unstable shelving
	rock / boulder
		slip / trip / fall harzards
		few places to get into water
		difficult for 999 to get on to beach
	Silt & mud
		gentle slopes
		danger of getting stuck in slit/mud and drowning with incoming tide
	
	gentle shelving
		sea bed - even predictable shallow slope
		easy to guess depth of water
	steep shelving - medium hazard
		sea bed - even predictable steep slope
		can be out of depth very quickly
		difficult o walk back to shore
	Sudden drop off - high hazard
		step off ledge in to very deep water
		suddenly out of depth
	Uneven surface - high hazard
		sea bed has differnet types of surface and depths	
		cant guess slope or whats on teh sea bed surface
		all harzards above exist

	NATURAL HAZARD

	flooding tide
		tide is coming in
		can cut people off, if cliffs, headlands, outcrops, sandbanks
		hide hazards seen at low tides
		catch users in inter-tidal zone, children may be knocked over
		changes flow of water round beach
			rip currents can sweep people out to sea
	ebbing tide
		tide going out
		reveal sandbars/harzards in inter-tidal zone
		change flow of water - rip currents
		users may stray to far from beach, especially on gentle slopes
	cliffs
		always eroding
			weather / rock type
		fences/paths now falling ofcliff edge
		cliff boulders large rocks - obvious danger
	
	MAN MADE HAZARDS
	
	piers
	supports
	groynes			may be blow surface at high tide
	sea walls
	flood defences
	erosion defences
	
	drums - checicals/expolsives may be washed up
	chemical containers have label - info for 999
	hazard warning signs

	Hazchem Code
		skull - poisonous
		drips - corrosive
		flame - flamable
		tree - environmental
		bomb - explosive
		ven diagram - bio hazard
		fan - radio active

	GHS - globally harmonised System

		punctured - explosive	
		flame - flamable
		drips - corrosive
		person - long term health
		exclamation - Caution
		canister - gas under pressure
		pipe/flame - oxidising
		skull - toxic
		Tree - danger to environment

	Natural/man-made hazrads are not a threat on their own
	become threat when people come in to contact
	
	surfers/body boarders/wind surfers/kayakers
	swimemrs / families / walkers 

	Recognising risk
	
	some bechs have higher risk factors
	some users are higher risk of harm
	identify these people when scanning
		identification / surveillance / and intervention
		may prevent accident

	identification - spotting high risk groups as they arrive
	surveillance - survey high risk spots / activities
	anticapation - understand key clues that tell whne an incident is likely
	intervention - swift appropriatae action if risk of accident occurring

	high risk groups

		men / boys
			stats show higher numbers in difficulty
			more likely to take risks
		babies / young children (<5)
			highest risk of drowning in still water
		16-35 
			especially younger men
			more activities that involve taking risks
			especially in groups
		elderly
			lack physical skill
		tourists visitors migrants
			dont know local area
			no experience of caostal hazarsd
			may not be dressed for beach conditions
			sunburned / no tan / ethnic groups may be visitors
			communication may be difficult
		medical conditions
			cardiac	
			circulation
			consciousness
			physical/mental disability may be at higher risk
		physically unfit
			activites usually involve excercise
		non-swimmers
			at risk in water
			in deep water - ny accident
		poo/weak swimmer
			over estimate ability
			under estimate beach environ
			rely on equipment, surf boards/ inflatables
			can begin to panic
		alcohol/medication/drug use
			dangerous to enter water
		not dressed properly
			jeans - less bouyant
		Novices
			new to something
			learning new activity
			may have low quality / hired equipmet

Top 5 safety tips for groups and families
		
	swim at LG-ed beach betweeen red/yellow flags
	never use inflatables in strong winds / rough sea
	check weather / tide times
	if in trouble - hand in air shout for help
	if see someone in rouble tell life guard
		if no LG call 999 / 112 - ask for coast guard
	
	children always be surpvised by adults
	agree on meeting in case get sepaarted
		eg LG station
	bright swimwear / fash vests 

	active supervision - best form
		for adults and children

Getting casualty out of water

	after rescue, move to safe area for check and treatment
	
	think about tide
	think about surface if they have to be carried/dragged

	be careful - principles of safe lifting/handling

Moving casualty who can walk

	help to walk
	signal for help if needed
	watch tripping over rescue equipment
	remove rescue tubes etc once out

	walk to shlter if psssible
	sit down on beach safe distance from edge
	treat as appropriate

	before going into water call for assistance
	so help can be on hand when returning to shore
	
Moving casualty who cannot walk

	1 or 2 person drag

		put arms under shoulders
		another LG can help by putting shoulder under arm pits 
		grasping round waist

		support head
		
		lift up and out of water - drag to safe place

		lie down - treat asap

		call for help
		
		hold under armpits - careful no to rtip on rescue ropes
		second person can lift by legs - above knees
		lift together, walk backwards
		persons holding legs can direct
		turn sideway to shore
		lower to ground in sitting position
		one supports upper body
		other removes any equipment
		carefully lie down
		provide first aid
	check list
 		stop think
		position feet
		good posture
		firm grip
		close to body
		dont jerk
		move feet
		put down / adjust
			
	CPR flow chart - adult/child/infant

		unresponsive/not breathing normally
		call 999 / ambulance
		if drowning child/infact 5 rescue breaths
		30 chest compressions
		2 rescue breaths
		continue CPR 30:2
		when arrives - switch on AED/follow instructions

Problems with CPR
		tracheostimes
			removal of voice box (laryngectomy)
			opening to windpipe (stoma)

			remove stoma cover / leave any tubes
			wipe mucus
			close casualty mouth/nose
			mouth around opening in neck
			blow - watch for chest rise
		regurgation
			water is often swallowed when drowning
			occurs during/after resusication
			material can enter airways/lungs
			pneumonia
			
			turn casualty away
			keep on side - use elbow/forearm to stop toppling
			turn head to floor
			mouth open - allow contents to drain
			clear debris from mouth
			turn on to back
			restablish airway
			continue CPR
		air in stomach
			head tilt/chin lift make not produce clear airway
			extra needed to blow past obstruction
			can drive air into stomach

			if stomach distends below lower left ribs
			interfers with diaphragm
			risk of vomitting
			
			improve airways, increase HTCL
			dont apply pressure on stomach
			if airway clear air will escape gradually

	CHEST PROBLEMS
		broken ribs
			ribs may break during comporessions
			elderly people

			can happen if hands are not correctly placed on sternum
			continue compressions

		chest not rising
			if initial rescue breath does not make chest rise then
				check mouth and remove any obstructions
				recheck HTCL
				dont try more than 2 breaths

		fluid in airway
			foam - mixing air and water comes from mouth
			just continue - dont try and remove

		CPR - when not from side
			over the head when not possible to do from side
			confined space

CPR and injury to spine

	if casualty has fallen
	struck on head/neck
	dives in shallow water

	maintain alignment of head / neck / chest

	get support from other team members if pssible

	if rescued to point of safety
		rescue board or horizonal spinal lift is required

	if breathing stops while on rescue board start CPR immediately

	try chin lift to avoid injury to spine
	only add chin lift if required - keep to as little as possible

	2 LGs
		1 knees at head, looking down line of body
		apply manual inline stabilisation
		keep elbows on floor
		2 performs CPR
		
		once airway is open, maintain head position

	1 LG	
		standard CPR
		resuscitation takes priority over spinal injury

	if need to turn onto side due to regurgation - smae principles apply

	LG doing manual inline stabilisation
		ensure effective comms to roll casualty on to side while
		keeping head neck chest inline

		any additional team members can assist with the roll
		eitehr on or off rescue board

		if on own - carry out normal procedure for regurg
		try and minimise any head/neck movement

	ACTIVITY HAZARDS

	Arise due to how people use pool
	may increase risk of accident
	tact / diplomacy and clear explanation of the problem

		The self appointed teacher
		Hyperventilating, swimming underwater
		ducking/pushing

	Adults teaching youngsters new skills
		particularly diving or in deep water
		educate them on dangers - eg no diving in shallow water

	Hyperventilating
		excessive breathing - could be caused by panic attack
		swimmer planning to swim underwater
			may pass out and drown - shallow water blackout
			discourage long swims underwater
				explain dangers
		applies to diving to bottom of pool
			educate anyone observed
		
		if they are already under
			track and educate

		People
			elderly / very young
			people under influence
			disabled swimmers


SUPERVISION OF SPECIALIST ACTIVITIES / EQUIPMENT

	Fins/ Flipeprs/Snorkels and Masks
	runner rings / bouyancy aids

	FINS/FLIPPERS/SNORKELS/MASKS

	can injure other swimmers
		intervene and stop during general settings

	untrained users - snorkels can inhale water
		reduce risk if programmed sessions

	masks only in structured setting (safety marked)
		observe rules in NOP


	RUBBER RINGS
	
	used as toys not aid
		stop inappropriate use
		insure weak swimmers are supervised
		dont use lane ropes gutters etc to get in deep water
		
	diving through rings
			
	failure 
		signage for weak swimmers and pool depths

	OTHER ACTIVITIES

		Canoeing
		Swimming club/lessons
		Lane swimming
		Water polo
		Inflatables
		mats & other floating equiopment

MAXIMUM POOL USER LOADS

	Varies by type of pool and session

	NOP set MPUL for each activity

	Sessions could be
		Inflatables
		Fun/mat sessions
		lane swimming
		senior dwim sessions
		gala & club sessions

	Type of session may alter no of LGs required

	as user numbers increase NOP will indicate the no of LGs

	NOP will identify methods for controlling swimmers
	band system
		swimmers have time limit and must leave when informed
	
	reception may control access and LG as a backup

	YOUR ROLE AS LG

	must know no of swimmers in their zone
	know when backup/support required to increase numbers

	Count swimmers every few minutes
		keep note of count on rotation
	
	call for assistance when pool users reaching max
		follow zone set out by employer

	Why is it important for LG to rotate efficiently & effectively

		maintain vigilance
			rotate between zones
		pass on vital info
			should only take a few seconds
			seek assistance if longer required

	TECHNOLOGY

	Drowning dection
	personable wearing drowning detection
	underwater cameras
	motion sensors
	poolside mirrors

	H&S Guidance Document 
		use of technology HSG 179 (para 118)
		devcies cannot 
			communicate with swimmers
			intervene to prevent accident
				innappropriate behaviour
			perform rescue
		
		Drowning prevention systems

		cameras in pool/overhead or both
			monitor activity
			detect patterns to detect swimmer in difficulty
			rais and alarm if someone needs assistance
			spot swimmer in difficulty
			spot person motionless on pool bottom
			screen to show LG where in pool difficulty 				has been detected

	
		cameras underwater/overhead 
			provide LG with view of all/part of zone
			visibilty of blind spots
			linked to screens (CCTV) 
				but dont give warnings
			NOP outline how often LG can scan screen
			LG still need 10:20 scanning protocol

		Motion Sensors / Mirrors

		something disturbs surface or boundary of pool
		
		used when pools are closed 
			but access cannot be restricted
		
		mirrors
			help blindspots

	Working with technology

		need training / fully understand systems
	
		How to use system
		How to do a 10 sec scan with system
		know what alarms sound/look
		what actions should take on alarm
		what action to take on system failure

		training
			manufacturer instructions & PSOP
		
		Systems tested and maintained 
			in line with manufacturers instructions

EAP - EMERGENCY ACTION PLAN

TOXIC GAS / CHEMICAL SPILL

	Roles & lines of comms 
	Evactuation Bag
		plans of building
		location/type/amount of chemical 
			in building/storage areas
		evac procedures
		lines of comms
		info for 999

	YOUR ROLE

		Radial (wrist)
		Carotid (neck)
		Brachial (inside upper arm)

	Moving and handling casualities

		never - unless life in danger or urgent need 
		leave undisturbed - call 999
		moving can increase injury or cause new injury

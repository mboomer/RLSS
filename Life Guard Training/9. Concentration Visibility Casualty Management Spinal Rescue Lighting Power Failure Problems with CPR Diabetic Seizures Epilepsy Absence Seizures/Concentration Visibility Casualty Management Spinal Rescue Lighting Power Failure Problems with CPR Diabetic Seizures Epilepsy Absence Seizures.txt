5 ways a LG can maintain concentratoon levels

LG needs to identify when level of alertness may be dropping

	e.g. day-dreaming
		need action to ensure suitable level of supervision maintained

	check posture
	alter standing/sitting position
	change scanning pattern
	head count swimmers in zone every 5 mins
	mentally identify swimmers most at risk in zone
	how many males/females 
	how many wearing goggles
	how many children < 8 in zone
	ayone that could get into difficulty

Maintaining Concentration

	no longer than 60 mins at poolside
	exeptional circumstances 90 mins
	
	regular rotation between positions 15/20/30 mins

	ensure workers (esp young) have adequate rest & time bewteen shifts
	european Working Time Directives

	NEVER talk on poolside unless:

		colleague passing on info
		need to intervene to prevent accident
		educate user on safety rules
		customer aks a question
			dodnt get distracted/keep conversation to min

	If supervision duties are comprised - call for team support
		
	turn up for work in fit/appropriate state	
	NEVER take phones
		leads to distraction
		could miss an accident
			- disciplinary action
			- criminal court action

Visibility

	pools may have several of these issues

	Glare & Reflection (natural light)

		harsh bright light caused by sun/artifical light 
		bounces of surface of pool
		can cause discomfort
		difficult to see through water
		pools with lots of glazing
		can be minimised in outdoor pools
			- LG polaroid sunglasses

	blind spots & poor lighting

		equipment in pool - infaltables/ mats
		pool design - irregular shape/walls/pillars
		high number of swimmers
		
		not always obvious - simple things can make it hard to see
			lane ropes / colored pool tiles
		
		if any difficulties ensure to report it immediately

		Poor/Old Pool Lightining
			can affcet seeing thru water
			design & position play a part
			broken bulbs
				report immediately
				should be on daily checklist


			
	turbulence & water clarity

		created by waves/rapids/swimmers can affcet ability to 
		see through water
		even a small amount of turbulence can affect seeing 		swimmers/objects under water
	
		visibilty can deteriorate suddenely/gradually
			air - mini bubbles drawn into system
			dirt - suncreams/tanning/makeup
				creates a film on water
			chemical imbalance

	
	if any impact ability to supervise 
		inform manager
		suitable action should be taken to ensure swimmer safety

Principles of casualty Management

	Accidents happen unexpectedly
	not always possible to know what happened
		nature of injury
		any damage to spine

	Stabilising head/neck/spine

		the higher the injury - higher potential paralysed
		1 - stablise headin neutral position
		2 - keep neck & upper spine support & inline
			inline stabilisation
		
	Maintaining horizontal position
	
		make sure casualty keep horizontal position
		all movement minimised
		carried out with great care

		an assisted lift NOT appropriate
		horizontal lift with/without rescue board/PXB

Incident Manage Priorities

	First priority - save a life

	if face down, casualty needs turned over to breath
	if unconscious - no response to "Are you alright?"
		remove from water immediately
		primary survey completed on poolside
	airways take priority over injury
	decisions must be based on priority of saving a life
	
	Key Priorities
		Save life
		Stabilise head/neck/spine
		maintain horizontal position

Spinal Rescue Techniques

	rescue is based on principle of keeping casualties head stable 
	and stabilisation of spine

	Vice Grip
	Head Splint
		this is wahat we used with PXB
		clamp arms up at side of head

	bodys natural center of gravity turns casualty face down

	first - turn over so they can breath
	use either vice/head splint 
		either can used if casualty is face up in water
	as soon as spinal injury is suspected
		implement EAP
		at least 
			make sure surrounding water is cleared
			wave/features turned off
			support LG/oter staff report to pool side
	Similarities
		both for spinal casualties
		3 whistle blasts
		state suspected spinal injury
		enter water sliding entry	
		aim to stabilise the head
		casualty starts face down - ends face up
		team work ewquired to lift casualty to pool side
	Differences
		head splint
			standing depth
			LG above water
			hand position
			movement technique - walk/static
		vice grip
			deep water
			LG is under water
			hand positions
			movement technique - swim
				tow to shallow position
		
Lighting or Power Failure

	rely on externa; power sources
	any outage can affect health/safety of users/staff
	LGs should act immediately
	
	outdoor pools 
		outage not immediately apparent
	
	outages can affect plant room controlling chemicals

	procedure will be in place
		detailing roles
		lines of comm

	Immediate action to atke on power failure
	Lines of comm
	evacuation and closure
	dealing with public

	evan daytome failure can cause significant operational/safety issues

	EAP details when & how to close building in controlled manner

	follow training, ensure LOCOMM are followed

	LG needs to know how to respond
		Daytime
		night time
		controlled closure
		emergency light & torches
		contactiong energy supplier/utility comp
		manage controlled evac of pool
		
		full building evac
			direct pool users to assembly points outside building

			manage young children
			manage swimming lessons/children
			evac of disabled swimming lessons

	even if you can see swimmers
		pool circulation/assistance alarms/comms 
			systems may not be working

	power bcakup systems may only work for short epriod

Problems with CPR

	before taking action activate the EAP

	start CPR asap after someone stops breathing/heart stops beating
	is vital if life is to be saved

	even when all trainign followed/corect sequence of actions
	problems amy arise when giving CPR

	stay calm and evalute what adjustments may be required

	tracheostomies
		if casualty has voice box remove (larygectomy) there will be
		an opening in windpipe (stoma)

		remove stoma cover - dont ermove any tube in place
		wipe any muscus from stoma or tube
		close casualtys nose/mouth
		place mouth round opening of stoma
		blow, watch chest rise/fall as in standard mouth-to-mouth

	Air in stomach

		if head titl/chin lift dont clear airway
		extra force will be needed when breathing to blow air 
		past any obstruction
		this may driv air in to stomach

		stomach distends below leftt ribs
		interfers with diaphram/air entering lungs

		casualty may also vomit

		attempt to improve airways by increasing head tilt/chin lift
		dont apply pressure on stomach
			this may induce vomiting

		if clear airway is maintained - air will likely escape gradually
	
	Broken ribs

		during compression ribs may break
			elderly/rigid chests

		can happen if hands are incorrectly placed on sternum
		if ribs break
			no action should be taken during resuscitation
			resuscitation should continue uninterrupted

		casualty may be in pain afterwards

	Chest does not rise

		oif initial breath of two does not make chest rise
		before next attempt, then

		check mouth and remove any obstructions
		recheck using adequate chin lift/head tilt
		do not attempt more than 2 breaths each time before 
		beginning compressions

	fluid in airway

		massive amounts of foam coming out of mouth
			casued by admixing air with water

		dont try and remove foam
		continue with bretahs/compressions

	CPR in confined spaces

		over the head CPRwhen its not possible to be side on
		victim may be in cubicle/flume spash down

	2 situations where rescue breaths by mouth-to-nose

		in water - when delay in response from team
		infact CPR - given by mouth/nose due to size of face
		injuries to mouth/jaw
		
Diabetic Emergency

	metabolic disorder
	blood sugar becomes high
	pancreas makes hormone (insulin) to help glucose get into cells
	sufferes must inject/take tablets

	hypoglycaemia - to little sugar
	hyperglycemia - to much sugar

	both are serious and can lead to unconsciousness

	hypoglycaemia - to little sugar
		may develop gradually
		casualty usually recognises signs/symptoms
			excessive thirst
			may need to pee
			drowsiness
		will manage ther own treatment

		Hyperglycemia
		LGs are less likely to deal with this type of casualty
			another indication may be rapid pulse & breathing					with sweet fruitly smell on breath
			should call 999/112
s
		rapidly deteriorating level of response
		insufficent food
		exercise/excess insulin

		SIGNS
			pale skin
			profuse sweating
			shallow breathing
			unconsciousness
			may appear drunk
		SYMPTOMS
			rapid pulse/may feel faint
			limbs tremble
			confusion
			may be aggressive
		TREATMENT
			Conscious
				sit down
				give sugery drink/gluscose tablets/choclate etc
				if not responding call 999/112
			Unconscious
				call 999/112
				breathiong normally
					recovery position
					monitor breathing
					monitor airway/breathing
				start CPR if required

				DONT give anything by mouth to unconscious
				casualty to anyone having difficulty
				breathing/swallowing
		
Siezures & Epilepsy
	recurrent seizures
	when brains function is disrupted
	caused by number of illnesses
	casualty may sense seizure coming on
	fit/convulsion

	SIGNS
		sudden collapse, breath out & stiffen, sink to bottom of pool
		muscles stiffen and back arch
		lips go blue
		limbs jerking
		eyes rolling
		teeth clench/saliva drool
		loud snoring like breathing
		loss of bladder/bowel control

	TREATMENT - IN WATER
		support keep face clear of water
		dont hit head on pool side
		keep in shallow water away from sides
		once over remove from pool
		casualty may feel tired/sleepy
		monitor breathging
		reassure them
		be prepared to start CPR
		999/112 - they ay have inhaled water
		DONT restrain - only move if danger of injury/falling in water
	TREATMENT - OUT OF WATER
		remove any objects
		protect head (soft under head)
		lossen clothing around enck
		note time/duration
		
		once over - rest quietly until recovered
		may be tired/sleepy
		if breathing normally - rescue position/monitor breathing

	TREATMENT
	
	be suspicious of cardiac arrest for anyone presenting with seizures
	assess casualty for breathing once seizure is over

	call for 999/112 if
		seizure last > 5 minutes
		second seizure occurs
		injury has occurred
		its the first ever seizure
		not alert after 10 mins recovery
		if its different/lasts longer than normal
		you are in any doubt

ABSENCE seizures
	casualty seems daydreaming
	common in children
	may be few secs
	casualty may be unware

	SIGNS
		jerking/twitching
		plucking at clothes
		swallowing reeatedly
		lip smacking
		wandering around dazed
	TREATMENT
		support with head above water
		guide away from pool/danger
		sit down/lie down in quiet place
		reassure
		stay until fully alert

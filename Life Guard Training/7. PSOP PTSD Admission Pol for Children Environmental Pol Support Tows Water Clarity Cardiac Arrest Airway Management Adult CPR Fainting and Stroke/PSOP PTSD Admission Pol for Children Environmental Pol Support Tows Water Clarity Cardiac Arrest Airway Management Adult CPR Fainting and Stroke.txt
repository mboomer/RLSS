PSOP - Pool Safety Operating Policy

	comprises 2 documents
	NOP - outlines safe d-2-d running of building
		details of the pool
		dimensions/depths/features/equipment/plan of building
		potential risks/appreciation of main hazrads of pool and users
		who are particluarly at risk
		dealing with public

	ensure staff/users are safe from injury or ill health

	procedures are pool specific

	in addition to PSOP there may be other procedures in place which you should be aware off
	follow up with employer on safeguarding, equality and diversity

PTSD

	a psychological & physical condition caused by a very frightening/distressing event
	such as an emergency is a pool

	feel isoolated/detached
	severe enough to impact on persons d-2-d life

	can be treated, even years after event
	differnent treatments are available

	LG can feel upset/anxious/depressed or stressed after an incident/accident
	employer will provide support

	LG with RLSS memberships can access couseling/breavement help lines

Admission Policy For Children

	pool operators should have policy which is communicated to users
	enforced by recpetion & LGs
	Managing H&S in Swimming Pools (HSG179)
		guidance on how many children under 8 a person more than 16 can supervise

	LG should understand their pools policy
	LG may have to remind adults of their responsibility to supervise their children 

Environmental Policy

	details companys commitment to preserving the environment

	recycling for emp and cust
	lighting - conserve energy - turn off areas/automatic lighting
	pool temperature - not waste energy
	water outlet - showers/taps with time /movement sensors/push activation
	pollution/waste discharge

	LG should understand policy and follow training

SUPPORT TOWS

	RLSS recommneds enter water with TB during in-water rescue
	
	support tow ued to keep casualty head above water
	used for responsive casualties
	casualty has free movement of hear and arms
	reduces panic

	effective over short distances

	LG should practice all tows 

	ARM
		suitable for weak / non swimmer in difficulty in deep water
		keeps most distance between LG and casualty
		maintains support and LGs head is above water
		can be used for longer distances

		grab underside of upper arm - right arm to casualties left arm
		position forearm across casualties back
		gently lift across shoulders to keep head out of water
		swim side stroke
		observe casualty
		be aware of direction LG is swimming
		when reach pool side both arms under casualty arms to support on poolside		
		
	HIP
		useful for panicing casualty
		hip elevates their position - reduces panicking
		you may be under water and may need to surface to breathe
		suitable for < 5m

		approach from rear
		dip below surface as you get close to casualty
		grasp under arm and around waist
		support with upper hip to evalate casualty
		swim side stroke
		observe casualty
		be aware of direction LG is swimming
		when reach pool side both arms under casualty arms to support on poolside		
	 
	UNDER SHOULDER
		alternative to hip support
		useful for larger casualties
		advantage is - shoulder is under armpit and can elevate their position
		this erduces their panicking

		you may be under water and may need to surface to breathe
		suitable for < 5m
	
		approach from rear 
			maybe best to approach underwater
		grab around waist - shoulder under their armpit
		keep side of face close to their back
		swim side stroke
		watch direction
		you may be underwater - surface to breathe

	check with operator which may be suitabble for your pool

EAP - Lack of Water Clarity

	malfunction in plant room - low cholrine levels/bubbling water
	poor bather hygiene
		not showering/cosmetic products - makeup/fake tan
	
	your ability to see full volume of water is essential to safety of users
	
	employer will have a procedure

		immediate action as soon as problem identified
		lines of communication
		pool evacuation/closure
		dealing with public

	water quality may also be hazardous

	essential to know what to do
	loss quality can be slow but can happen quickly
	following training ensures all lines of communication are followed

	once first step is taken, subsequent steps amy be

	additional LGS directed to investigate situation while supervison levels are maintaned/increased

	thorw object to see if bottom of pool be seen
	monitor improvement/deterioration of visibility

	conduct pool water test & report to supervisor

	if previous steps fail - evacuate
	evacuate in controlled/safe manner

	safety of users leaving is your responsibility

	good communication with users is essential

	complete indicent report form

CARDIAC ARREST

	heart has stopped umping blodd around body

	asystole - completely stopped beating
	ventricular fibrillation - twitching in irregular/ineffectve manner

	no circulation of blood

	may be caused by lack of oxygen
	asphysixia / drowning
	direct damage through injury
	coronary thrombosis (heart attack)
	electric shock
	medical condition

	casualty may lose comsciousness
	if heart not restarted could die within minutes

	URGENT ACTION NEEDED

	blood flow to brain is zero
	can cause siezures - may be confused with epilipsey
	so be suspicious
	assess casualty for normal breathing once seizures have stopped

	CPR will buy time until 999 arrives

PRINCIPLE OF AIRWAY MANAGEMENT

	aurway may closed
	head tilt  chin lift
		procedure to prevent tongue blocking upper airways
	titl head bcakwards in unconscious patients
	
	DRABC

	D - Dangers
	R - Response
	A - airway
	B - breathing
	C - circulation

 Sequence of CPR - Adult	

	in an emergency, before taking action, always activate the EAP

	primary Survey - suppirts priorities of casualty management

	activate EAP
	make sure you, casualty & bystanders are safe
	check casualty, seeif they respond
	gently shake shoulders, "are you alright"

	if no response

	turn onto bcak
	open airway using head tilt/chin lift
	place hand on forehead/ gently tilt back
	place fingertips under point of chin and lift to open airway

	keep airway open - look listen and feel for nothing breathing for 10 secs
	looks for chest movement
	look at mouth for breathing
	feel for air on cheek
	
	for first few minutes after CA casualty may be bearly breathing
	or taking slow/infrequent noisey gasps (agonal)
	agonal gasps are indication to start CPR immediately
	
	if in any doubt start CPR immediately

	if casualty is not breathing normally

	implement EAP
	ask helper to call 999
	saty with casualty

	activate spealer fucntion on phone when talking to 999

	send someone to find/get AED

	dont leave casualty to get AED unless it is in immediate vacinity

	start CPR

	follow DRABC steps quickly as possible 

	CHEST COMPRESSIONS

	knee by side
	heel of one hand in center of chest - lower half of sternum
	place other hand on top of first hand
	interlock fingers
	dont press on ribs
	arms straight
	dont apply pressure over upper abdomen or bpottom of sternum

	position shoulders verticall above chest
	press down - depth 5-6cms
	release pressure - stay in contact
	repeat 2/sec for 30 compressions

	RESCUE BREATHS

	open airway again with head tilt and chin lift
	give 2 rescue breaths

	pinch soft part of nose, with index/thumb
	allow mouth to open, maintain chin lift
	take breath, place mouth over casualty mouth
	blow steadily - watch for chest to rise

	should not take > 10secs to deliver 2 breaths

	if first breath does not make chest rise
	check casualty mouth and remove any visible obstructions
	ensure there is adequate head tilt/chin lift

	dont do more than 2 rescue breaths before returning to chest compressions

	continue with 30 compressions 2 rescue breaths

	AED

	if AED arrives, switch AED on and use - following your training

	continue CPR
	dont interrupt resuscitation until
		health professional tells you to stop
		you become exhausted
		casualty is awake, open eys, moving and breathing normally

	it is rare for CPR to restart the heart
	unless you certain person has recovered, continue with CPR

	If casualty is breathing normally move into recovery position

	ensure EAP has been implemented and help from 999 is on way

	only leave the casualty if there is no other way to get help

	continue to asses for normal breathing - if in any doubt continue CPR

	CHEST COMPReSSION ONLY CPR

	if you arent able to give rescue breaths
		maybe facial injury to casualty
		give chest compressions only
		100-120/minute
FAINTING

	temp reduction in blood supply to brain
	dizziness - then collapse

	lay down
	raise legs
	check airway

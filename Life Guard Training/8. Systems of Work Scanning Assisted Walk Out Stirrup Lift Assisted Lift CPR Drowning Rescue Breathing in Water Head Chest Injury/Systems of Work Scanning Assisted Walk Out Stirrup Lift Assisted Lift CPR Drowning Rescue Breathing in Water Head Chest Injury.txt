Sample NOP
	Normal Operation Procedures
	
	followiing a risk assessment, a procedure with NOP containing 
		risk factors
		set sysyems of work
		operational systems
	
	LG role

	Potential Risks
		what site specific hazards exist
		memebers of staff can be trained and aware
		to ensure safety of themselves and others

	employer completes a detailed list of hazards
	Each pool will have its high risk areas
	control measures on how to d=reduce risk of accident/injury

	accident analysis
		details cause and location of accident
		allows systems and procedures to improved

	Knowing the hazards will help to intervene early
	educate users and supervise users
	LG should know all risk of each pool
	Zone info cards identify each area LG is responsible for
	as wella s in NOP
	Orientation sessions underpin knowledge and assist you learn

	LG should know most common accidents that occur
	and where they occur
	enables ypu to be more proactive LG
	inform line manager if you think more can be done to prevent accident or injury

	Systems Of Work

	One potential risk factors are identified
	control measures are developed by systems of work
	
	Employer will set out work arrangements for safety of you and users

	Lines of comm and supervison
	Work rotation / shift patterns
	Poolside rotation - statis/high chair positions
	max pool work time - in one session/shift...in exceptional/temp measures

	You role as LG is to understand the rules of your pool
	in accordance with trianing and procedures set out by employer
	essentail you adhere to systems set out
	
	3 access controls that a pool can use to ensure entry to pool is controlled

	gates
	shutters
	turnstiles
	lockable doors
	barriers
	fllor covers/moveable floors
	staff to prevent entry
	
	entry to unsupervised pool must be rubust
	signage, unlocked dorr is not sufficient
	as bathers can ignore them and force entry

	Operational SYstems

		How operators control risk factors

	access to pool
	how long you can work
	safe use of equipment

	Gates / locks / Staff / safe use of Pool covers

	LG role is to udnerstand rules and apply according to training and
	procdures set iut by employer

	5 things to check when opening/closing swimming pool

	opening
		check LG eqipment is available
		in working order and in correct position
		test pool alarms
		check high chairs are correctly positioned
		pool is set up for first session, lanes ropes/signage
		water test
		fire exits not blocked
		visual check, floor tiles, grates etc
	CLosing
		all bathers are out of pool
		all eqipment is place in correct position
		pool set up for first ssession next morning
		final pool water test
		fire exits are closed
		ensure gates/chutters/doors are closed/locked
		visual check - floor tiles/grates etc

	checks can minimise potential risk factors
	employer will have list of tasks before opening and after closing

	Opening
		check LG eqipment is available
		in working order and in correct position
		test pool alarms
	Closing
		all bathers are out of pool
		fire exits are secure

Scanning

	Careful supervisoon by qualified and competent Lgs and early intervention
	is best way to prevent accidents

	scan to ensure full surface area and volume is covered
	so no swimmers are missed

	LG needs good level of vision

	Scanning
		LG must take in what is happening in a particluar zone wothout concentrating so long ona particular point 
		that rest of zone is not covered
		it can take seconds to drown
		so important not to be distracted
		if zone is left uncovered - increased chance of accident/injury or a missed 
		opportunity to intervene early

	How to Scan
		constantly watching particular part, zone
		or whole pool using a sweeping action by moving head

		inlcude whole environment as well as pool itself

	watch out for		
		known hazards
		swimmer numbers
		swimmers submerging
		anxiety/concern on users faces
			either at side or in water
		user trying to attract your attention
 		erratic frantic swimming or movements
		the very young
		inappropriate behaviour

	it is better to take action and find out it is not required than not to 
	take action and find out that earlier intervention would have prevented 
	or reduced severity of a potential serious accident

	Observation is more than looking
	you must be able to identify potential hazards
	spot subtle reactions
	expressions on users face

	and so ensure no swimemr requires urgent assistance

		Listen for cries/calls for help
		people arguing
		equipment being broken/misused

		listen for signals/instructions from otehr LGs

		Smell of alcohol - swimer may not be fit to swim
		Smell of chemicals/smoke - emergency in building

	experience of the pool will help
	as you learn the stes/sounds/characteristics/patterns/rythms of the pool
	you will be able to spot anything irregular
	
	some swimmers may struggle - maybe hard to spot in busy pools
	otehrs may become unconscious on surface
	slip quietly below the surface - silent drowning

	must include looking through the water to bottom of pool
	as well as observing the surface
	so be aware of users diving/jumping/swimming underwater

	Scanning Techniques

	steadily move line of sight across zone
	moving L to R ensuring complete area, including volume is covered
	head may be moved side to side or up/down
	include bottom of pool close to edge
	particularly if in high chair

	foucs on users/what are they doing
	make eye contact - faces can give early warning of distress/concern
	dont concentrate on one feature/swimmer for too long
	when changing position dont stop scanning

	before start scannig completely befoer taking over
	note any comments by LG you are taking over from
		but dont stop scanning while passing on info
		also important when dealing with pool users
	if needed call for others if scanning is compromised

	Scanning Patterns

	Operators may have pattern need to use
	howver ensure you can whoe zone every 10 secs
	scan through the water to bottom 
		users can get into difficulty any point between surface and bottom
	dont just scan teh surface

	Example
		scan from one end to other
		continuly moving along pool to ensure whole pool is covered
		start back at beginning after 10 seconds
	
		each LG will scan from one side to other
  		continuly moving along pool to ensure whole pool is covered
		start back at beginning after 10 seconds
		
		LG scans in a circuit
		continuly moving towards the middle to ensure whole pool is covered
		start back at beginning after 10 seconds
			
		LG will scan from one side to other
  		continuly moving along pool 
		then across the pool in other direction
		to ensure whole zone is covered
		start back at beginning after 10 seconds

Casualty Recovery and exits from Water

	following rescue casualty must be helped from water
	and moved to safe place - preferrably away from poolside
	for first aid and recovery

	take care not injure yourself/casualty during manual lifting
	Operator will have risk assessed manualing tasks
	and lifting casualties out of poll during an emergency or during training

	RLSS UK does not approve of unassisted lifting during 
	training or rescue emergency

Rescue from Beach/Shallow Water Area

	2 types of recovery
		assess site specifics and casualty type
		
	Assisted Walkout
		when casualty is exhausted/distressed but can walk with help
		after rest, slide head under armpit
		arm around waist/shoulder
		casualty arm across shoulder
		walk to point of safety
		a second LG may be required if casualty is heavy

	Pull AShore
		if pool bottom gently slopes, baech area
		casualty cannot help themselves ( unresponsive)
		take to waist depth...with anotehr LG
		walk backwards
		back straight
		both holding under armpit
		both holding wrists
		walk to point of safety

Stirrup Lift

	Can be used to help climb out of water
	often used to land casualty from a support position in the water

	Move behind
	reach down
	cup one hand under foot/knee
	take firm grip of poolside
	using a lift instrcut casualty to climb out and move away from edge

Assisted Lift

	several factors affect how easy a casualty can be lifted from teh water

	distance from surface and edge of pool (freeboard)
	design of pool troughs/rails
	if casualty is conscious
		move to shallow water so LG assisting them is able to stand firmly on bottom
	LG should be fit and healthy
	reduces likehood of injury when lifting
	but remember good lifting technique
	may need to start rescue breaths in water until assistance arrives to help
	move casualty from water

	ONly lift if it absolutiely necessary
	if they can walk/climb - let them
	
	make firm base with feet (shoulder width)
	lift using knees
	keep casualty as close to body as possible
	if need to turn, move feet...dont twist bcak
	
	to land casualty 2 or more LGs are needed
	once LGs are ready on poolside
	one take charge of lift
	LG1 may remain in water and can assist by supporting and lifting
	casualtys hips

	In an emgency mains things can be considered

EAP - BOmb Threat

	system to deal with bom threat
	terrorist attack

	action to take if alerted to bom threat/threat of terrorism
	lines of comm
	evacuation procedure
	suspicious package procedure
	staff roles/responsibilities

	LG actions during a bomb threat
		manage controlled evacuation
		direct users to assembly points
		keep exits clear
		evacuate children/vulnerable adults
		report suspicious items via lines of comm
	
		dont 
			investigate packages
			wait until next rotation
			press evacation alarm

	Must understand your role
	follow site specific training		

More than one rescuer and CPR

	important to work in teams
	chest compression is tiring
	take it in turn -change every 2 minutes
	minimumd eley during change over
	applys to all types of casualty
	communicate c;learly and assertively to each other
	if AED is available it should be summoned and used with minimal delay

Drowning and CPR

	results from asphyxia from immersion in water
	casualties head is underwater anda air cannot get to lungs
	water enter mouth, results in closure of airways

	similar to reaction to stop food/liquid entering lungs during eating

	the airway seals to stop water getting to lungs
	but this means they cant breath

	first action
		lift casualties head clear of water
		make sure airway is open
	
	if they remain submerged they will swallow water.
	lack of oxygen casuse unconsciousness and stop trying to breath
	the rreflex relaxes and water enters the lungs
	death follows shortly

	there maybe a medical condition or cause
	they cause casualty to collapse in water/fall into water
	stroke/heart attack/hyperventilation/asthma attack/seizures/hypothermia

	aas they are short of oxygen
	rescue breaths are priority

	commence with 5 rescue breaths - but call for 999/AED first

	if the rescue breaths dont chest rise then before next attempt

		check mouth for obstructions
		recheck adequate head tilt/chin lift
		dont use more than 5 breaths before starting compressions

	effects of drowning - care on recovery

		effects can be delayed for upto 72 hours
		important anyone submerged more than a few seconds or has needed
		resuscitation call 999//112 even if they seem to have filly recovered

CPR - Rescue Breathing in Water and Recovery 

	if possible recover casualty onto poolside, with help from team
	if not available, you may strat rescue breathing in water

	impossible to perform compressions
	but possible to perform rescue breats whislt upsupperted in water
	this is difficult and requires skill and stamina
	results in delay in recovering casualty onto poolside

	On reaching support
	
	Suppeort Method 1
		support casualty 1 arm under neck 
		grip side of pool
		use other hand to tilt chin
	SUpport Method 2
		swim casualty to poolside
		free arm nearest pool edge
		towing arm holds chin
		move other arm under neck and shoulders
		grip side of pool
		if assistance is available recover onto poolside
		if thehers a delay
			look/listen/feekl for normal breathing
			10 seconds
		if not breathing normally
			chin lift
			start rescue breaths
			use mouth to nose technique
			maintain chin lift...keep casualties mouth closed
			form seal round mouth and nose
			continue rescue breaths until assistance can recover to poolside
		once on poolside
			reassess for normal breathing
			if not breathing
			maintain head tilt
			give 5 rescue breaths
			30 chest compressions
			continue 2 breaths - 30 compressions
		ensure 999 has been called

	as soona s help arrives
	remove casualty from water
	moth to nose is preffered in water becasue it frees an arm to support
	the casualty and to hold on to side

Fill in Gaps in CPR sequence

	unresponsive and breathing normally
	call 999 and ask for an AED
	if adult, child,, infact give 5 rescue breaths
	30 compressions
	2 rescue breaths
	continue CPR at ratio of 30:2
	as soon as AeD arrives switch it on and follow instructions

Head Injuries

	cause serious injury
	dizziness confusion unconsciousness

	concussion
		blow/injury to head
		altered level of consciousness
		disorientated
		confused
		lack ability to remember
		briefly go unconscious

	compression
		potentially fatal
		pressure to brain from traumatic head injury (fracture)
		bleeding
		not essential to diagnose type of injury
		as all are serious, qualified emergency help should be called
	skull fracture
				
	SIGNS/SYMPTOMS
		changes in skin color(pale/clammy/flushed)
		unusual breathing
		blood in white of eye
		dilated pupils
		bleeding from ear/nose
		bleeding/bruising/swelling of head
		soft area/depression in skull
		dizzyness/confusion
		nausea/vomiting
		short term memory loss
		headache (mild/intense)
		possible seizures

	TREATMENT
		call 999/112
		if conscious
			lie down, keep head/neck and body in line 
			in case theres a neck injury
			look for/treat any other injuries
		if unconscious
			but breathing normally
			recovery position
			monitor breathing

Chest Injury

	sharp object penetrates chest wall
	life threatening internal damage in chest/upper abdomin
	may damage to lungs
	knife/metal spike/screw driver

	blunt force trauma
		blow/ fall
		ribs to fracture
	lower rib fractures can damage speen/liver
	
	chest injury can affect abaility to breathe
	cause severe pain

	can allow air to be sucked into chest cavity which causes lung to collapse

	SIGNS/SYMPTOMS

		where open wound, may hear air being suckedinto cavity
		blue/grey skin
		frothy coughed up blood
		sound of air being sucked in as casualty breathes
		difficult/painful breathing
		uneven/shallow breathing
		severe/acute pain

	TREATMENT

		call 999/112
		sit in most comfortable position
		lean towards the injured side
		dont cover an open chest wound with air tight dressing
			allows pressure to build up in chest
			inteferes with lungs (tension pneumothorax)
		control associated bleeding with direct pressure
		as long as conscious...keep in same position
		if beomes unconscious
			breathing normally
				place in recovery position
				injured side down
				monitor breathing
			not breathing normally
				start CPR
FLAIL CHEST
	if ribs have been fractured this can create a section of rib called
	a flail chest
	casualty breaths in
		chest wall expands as mormal
		the flail section moves in
		when exhaling
		the section moves out while chest wall moves in
	
	SIGNS/SYMPTOMS

		painful shallow breathing
		severe difficulty when breathing
		symptoms of fracture
		paradoxial chest movements

	TREATMENT

		call 999/112	
		sit in most comfortable position
		lean towards the injured side
		support arm on injured side to keep weight of arm away from injury
			elevation sling
		as long as conscious...keep in same position
		if beomes unconscious
			breathing normally
				place in recovery position
				injured side down
				monitor breathing
			not breathing normally
				start CPR

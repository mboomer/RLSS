Overview of H&S

	Take reasonable care for the health and safety of themselves and others
	Contribute to safety arrangements and development of PSOP
	Co-operate with employer to enable them to carry out their duties

Safety Signage	

	H&S Safety (Safety Sign & SIgnals)  1996
	
	Requires employers to use a sign where there is a significant risk to H&S that has not been avoided 
	by or controlled by the methods required under other relevant law, provided use of a sign can 
	help reduce risk.

	No Diving 			RED	PROHIBITION		prohibit behavior likely to increase or cause danger
	Caution Slippery Surface	YELLOW	WARNING			warning of hazard or danger
	Keep Locked			BLUE	MANDATORY		specific behavior, eye protection, PPE 
	Emergency Exit			GREEN	EMERGENCY/FIRST AID	exits, first aid or rescue facilities

Equality & Diversity

	Equality
		Ensure individuals or groups of individuals are treated fairly
		Should not be treated less favourably, but specifically to their needs 
		including race, gender, disability, religion/belief, sexual orientation, age

		Remove discrimation in all areas above
		Bully, harassment, victimisation are considered equalityand diversity issues

	Diversity
		Recognise, respect and value peoples differences, varity and individuality
		Inclusive culture where all colleges and customers can contribute and develop full potential

How can lifeguards promote E&D

	All colleges/customers deserve an equal service
	Treat all work colleges and customers fairly
	Understand, engage fully, listen and support others needs
	
Risk Assessment
	Look at a pool and identify all hazards that have potential to cause harm
	identify control measures to reduce the likelihood of an accident actually happening

	HAZARD			something with potential to cause harm
	RISK			likelihood that harm will be caused
	CONTROL MEASURE		something put in place to prevent hazard causing harm
					eg sign/procedure/training

	Should cover
		Premises & Utilities	Design, structure, features, power and water
		Tasks & Activities	cleaning, inflatables
		People			pool users, ages, numbers, behaviour

	5 Steps to complete Risk Assessment

		Identify Hazards
		Decide who might be harmed and how
		Evaluate risks and decide on precautions
		Record findings and implement them
		Review assessment and update if required

Spinal Cord & Nervous System

	33 vertabrae
	supports skull
	attaches to ribs
	in between vertebrae are cartilage discs
		allow limited movement
		prevent friction
		absorb shock

	spinal cords runs down center of spine and sends signals to brain to control movement of the body
	
	the higher the spinal injury the more paralysis occurs
	

	HISTORY IS KEY
	
	Cause of accident may indicate likelihood of an injury
	
	Symptoms and Signs
		Injuries from diving/collisions
		Injuries from diving boards, platforms, flumes or inflatables
	Symptoms
		Lack of movements/power in one or more limbs
		disorientation/bewilderment
		numbness/tingling
		pain in neck/back
	Signs
		Casuality floating face down, unable to turn over but not unconscious
		bruising/swelling around head neck or spine
		deformation/irregularity of spine
		loss of muscle control
		unconsciousness

Principles of casualty Management

	Stabilise head and neck and upper spine
		stabilise in neutral position known as inline stabilisation

	Maintain a horizontal position
		When rescuing from water, casualty is kept horizontal and movement is minimised
		great care must be taken
		assisted lift coud cause further damage
		recomend rescue boards PXB board

Incident Management Priorities

	first prioroty of a LG is to save a life
	
	If causualty is face down, they will need to turn face up
	
	Airway takes priority over the injury
	
	Save a life
	stabilitise head, neck upper spine
	maintain horizontal position

Choking - Adult

	occurs when food or other object is swallowed but goes down windpipe (trachea) 
	rather than gullet (oesophagus)

	MILD
		dislodge by coughing, 

		Signs & Symptoms

			Was casualty seen eating?
			child observed putting small object in mouth
			Casualty choking often grips throat with one or both hands
	
	MILD
		can speak, cough, but breathing and obviously distressed

	SEVERE	unable to speak, weak cough, struggling to breath, 
		face may be blue, veins on neck
		May also become unconscious

	Adult/Child/Infant

		   ------------------ASSESS SEVERITY -------------
		   |						  |
		SEVERE						MILD
	   ineffective cough				  effective cough
		   |					  |
		   |					encourage coughing until it becomes 
		   |					ineffective or blockage is relieved
	    ---------------------------------
	    |				     |
	UNCONSCIOUS			CONSCIOUS				
	    |			              |		
     Start CPR immediately		  CHILD/ADULT
						UPTO 5 back blows
						UPTO 5 Abdominal thrusts
					      |
					 INFANT
					     NO addominal thrusts 
					     Deliver UPTO 5 chest thrusts
		

BURNS & SCALDS

	Dry burn 	hot surface, friction, fire
	Wet Burn	steam hot liquid
	chemicals	cleaning/pool
	electrical	sockets/extension leads/portable heaters
	sunburn		outdoor pools/tanning beds

	SUPERFICIAL
		Outer layer
		red/tender/swelling may start
	PARTIAL
		outer layer & epidermis
		red/raw/blisters due to fluid released from damaged tissue
	FULL
		All layers
			nerves, fat tissues, muscle and blood vessels
		looks charred or waxy
		pain be absent if nerves are damaged
	
	TREATMENT
		Flood with water for at least 10 MINUTES
		dont remove clothing sticking to burn
		remove, rings/watches/jewelery before swelling starts
		cover with a non-adhesive sterile dressing
		if possible loosely wrap in cling film

		Treat for shock

	May need 999/112 if
		child or elderly
		is severe or you are unsure
		burn is deep
		burn covers face, hands, feet or genitals
		burn extends around a limb, neck arm or leg
		burn covers area greater than casualtys hand (1% of body)
		burn from chemical
		casualty breathed smoke or fumes from chemical

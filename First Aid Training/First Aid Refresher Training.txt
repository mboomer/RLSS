The Human Body

circulation
	arteries
		--> oxygenated blood away from heart
	veins	
		--> de-oxygenated blood back to heart

Brain
	most sensitive part of the body
	if heart stops, no blood is pumped round the body
	no oxygen is carried to brain
	in secs - lose conciousness
	in mins - will die

Starting CPR after stop breathing and heart is stopped is vital if life is to be saved

Priorities of CPR and First Aid

	Initial care/first aid given to a person who is ill/injured

	The application of acceptable life saving skills & FA knowledge
	to care for casualty until more qualified help has arrived

	P 		P 		P 		A
	Preserve	Prevent 	Promote		Alleviate

	Preserve Life
	Prevent situation getting worse
	Promote recovery	
	Alleviate suffering

Priorities when treating a casualty

	Life threatening emergencies
		take priority over all other injuries

	1 Emergency CPR
	2 Management of choking
	3 Life threating bleeding (may be no 1 - catastrophic bleeds)
	4 Unconscious breathing casualty
	5 shock
	6 medical attention

Hygiene Prodedures

	Your safety
	Safetly of other team members
	Hygiene
	Needles & Sharps
		not normally in FA Kits
		for anaphalaxis dispose of pen in 
		needle/sharps containers

	protective gloves
	aprons
	wash hands before & after contact
	cuts/scratches are covered
	dont touch wound/dressing in contact with a wound
	dont talk/sneeze/cough close to wound/dressing
	follow disinfection/cleaning procedures for bodily fluids/blood

Permission to give first aid

	Where possible - ask permission
	if no permission - call 999/112
	no consent - assault

Scene Survey

	    HISTORY   SYMPTOMS  SIGNS 
		|_______|________|
		        |
		     FIRST AID

	HISTORY
		what happened to cause injury
		casualty be able to inform 
		ask witnesses
		Where is casualty liying
		Check medical factors
			medication / allergies
			alert bracelets
		surounding equipment/position on ground

	SYMPTOMS
		What casualty tells you
			stiffness/loss of feeling
			tenderness/pain/temperature
	SIGNS
		What you can see/hear/feel
			bruising/problem to joint or limb
	APPLYING FA
		The treatment you give
		Use history/signs/synptoms to decide best treatment
		
Primary Survey

	assess casualty for life threatening injuries
	taking immediate and appropriate action for each stage

	D	DANGERS		any danger to you/casualty
	R	RESPONSE	does casualty respond
	A	AIRWAYS		is airway clear/open	
	B	BREATHING	is casualty breathing
	C	CIRCULATION	any severe bleeding

	complete each step before moving on

Principles of airway management

	Head Tilt / Chin Lift
		opens airway

Cardiac Arrest

	Aeostle / Ventricial fribilation

	heart stops pumping blood around the body

	blood flow to brain is ZERO, may casue seizures like EPILIPSY
	MUST assess for breathing once seizures stop

	Agonal Gasps
		infrequent, slow, noisy gasps (snoring sounds)
		START CPR IMMEDIATELY

Turning a casualty front to back

	knee by side
	turn head to face away from you
	place arm nearest above casualties head
	place arm furtherest away by side
	grip shoulder / wrist & hip
	roll towards you, against thighs
	lay gently on back, support head/shoulders
	place extended arm by side

	act carefully but as quickly as possible

Recovery Position

	unconscious but breathing normally
		except if suspect spinal injury

	stops toungue failing back and blocking airways
	reduces risk of vomiting

	remove any glasses
	knee beside casualty
	straighten legs
	arm nearest at right angle to casualties body
	other arm elbow bent, palm facing up, against face
	raise far leg, hold above knee
	roll towards you
	adjust leg at right angles 
	tilt head back and down to open airways and all fuild to drain
	regularly check breathing

	turn after 30 minutes

Chain of survival

	early recognition
		call for help
		get professional help 999/112
	early CPR
		to buy time
	early defib
		controlled electric shock
		to restart the heart
	post resuscitation care
		
		
CPR Flow Chart
	
	Unresponsive/Not Breathing Normally

		call 999/ambulance

		drowning/child/infant
			5 rescue breaths

		30 compressions
		2 rescue breaths
			if chest doesnt rise
				check mouth/remove obstruction
				check head tilt/chin lift
				dont try more than 2 breaths
		continue 30:2
			when AED arrives start immediately

Adult CPR

	Unconscious adult/not breathing

	Primary Survey and CPR
	
	start with 30 compressions
	
	5-6cms

	
AED - automated extrenal defibrillation

	turn it on as soon as it arrives	
	follow voice prompts
	
	bare chest area
	attach pads to chest

	semi automatic
		prompt to deliver shock
	fully automatic
		delivers shock if detects heart rythm is shockable	
		
	CLEAR
	
	after shock delivered, start CPR 30:2

	if no shock is indicated continue CPR 30:2

Problems with CPR

	tracheostomies
		remove stoma cover
		remove mucus
		close casualties nose and month
		place mouth around opening in neck
		blow, watching chest rise/fall
	regurgitation
		can occur after resuscitation
		turn away
		support with forearm
		turn head down and clear airways
		once clear continue CPR
	Air in stomach
		stomach appears distended
		clear airways with head tilt/chin lift
	broken ribs
		may occur during compression
		carry on with CPR
	chest does not rise
		after initial rescue breath
		check airways
		increase head tilt/chin lift
		dont attempt more than 2 breaths at a time
	fluid in airways
		massive amount of foam from mouth
		continue rescue breaths and compressions

Child and Infant CPR

	infant - 1st year of life
	child - from 1st year to puberty

	similar to a adult

	always give 5 rescue breaths before starting CPR

	infant - use 2 fingers

	continue with 30:2

When to stop CPR

	health pro advises to stop
	you are physically exhausted
	casualty is waking up, moving, opening eye & breathing normally

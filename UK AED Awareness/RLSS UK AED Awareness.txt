RLSS UK AED Awareness

Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) are devices that deliver conterolled electric shocks that allow the heart to try to beat normally.

Most heart attacks are due to abnormal, fast irregular beat of the heart called ventricular fribrillation VF

Electrical defribulation is well established as only effective treatment to terminate VF and allow heart to beat normally

Only use if casualty is unconscious and not breathing normally
	always call 999/112

What is AN AED
	Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) 
	small portable devices that check a person's heartbeat 
	delivers a controlled electrical shock 
		if the casualty's heart is not beating effectively
		also known as a cardiac arrest.
 	
	All AEDs use voice prompts to guide the person using the machine
	The majority are semi-automatic and prompt the operator to deliver the shock by pressing a button.
	A fully-automatic AED will deliver a shock with no further intervention from the operator if it 
	detects that the heart rhythm is shockable

WHY USE AN AED
	
	designed to be sued effectivwly by members of the public
	some turn automatically when opened 
		otehr need to be turned on

	prompt use within minutes of collapse
		increase survival rates by 75%

	chance of survival falls by 10% with every minute of delay

	Open lid
	start and listen to instructions
	
	Apply to upper right chest/and lower right rib cage
		remove/open clothing on upper body
		dry chest where pads are placed
		shave excessive hair if needed
		remove piercings/cover with plasters
	
	plug pads into AED	
	
	Analysing casualty
		no one touches casualty
		stand clear
	
	if AED finds a rythm that needs to be shocked
		it will instruct to press shock button
		shock may be delivered automatically
		makes sure no touches the casualty

	After shock is delivered - resume/start CPR
	If no shock - start CPR

SAFTEY ISSUES
	Dont touch casualty during analysis/charging/delivery of shock

	Shout stand clear, check visually no-one touches casualty
